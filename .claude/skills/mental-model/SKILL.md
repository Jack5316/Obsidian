# Mental Model Skill

Applies Charlie Munger's multi-disciplinary mental model approach to decision-making, leveraging key academic theories from basic subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, economics, and more.

## What It Does

1. **Multi-Disciplinary Framework** - Draws from 8+ core academic disciplines
2. **Key Mental Models** - Applies 20+ foundational mental models from various fields
3. **Decision Analysis** - Structured framework for evaluating complex decisions
4. **Cognitive Biases** - Identifies and mitigates common thinking errors
5. **Latticework of Models** - Combines models for better understanding

## Core Mental Models by Discipline

### Mathematics
- **Compound Interest** - Exponential growth over time
- **Probability** - Bayesian thinking and statistical reasoning
- **Permutations & Combinations** - System counting
- **Power Laws** - Non-linear relationships

### Physics
- **Inertia** - Objects resist change
- **Critical Mass** - Tipping points in systems
- **Leverage** - Amplifying forces
- **Feedback Loops** - Reinforcing and balancing systems

### Chemistry
- **Activation Energy** - Energy required to start reactions
- **Catalysts** - Accelerating processes
- **Equilibrium** - Stable system states

### Biology
- **Evolution** - Natural selection and adaptation
- **Ecosystems** - Interconnected systems
- **Redundancy** - Backup systems for reliability

### Psychology
- **Incentives** - Powerful drivers of behavior
- **Loss Aversion** - Pain of loss > pleasure of gain
- **Confirmation Bias** - Seeking confirming evidence
- **Availability Heuristic** - Judging likelihood by ease of recall

### Economics
- **Opportunity Cost** - What you give up to get something
- **Marginal Utility** - Additional benefit of each unit
- **Supply & Demand** - Price equilibrium
- **Comparative Advantage** - Specialization benefits

## Usage Examples

When presented with a decision, analysis, or problem, apply the mental model framework by:

1. **Identify Relevant Disciplines** - Which fields apply to this situation?
2. **Select Applicable Models** - Which mental models from those disciplines?
3. **Analyze from Multiple Perspectives** - View the problem through each lens
4. **Look for Contradictions & Confirmations** - Where do models agree/disagree?
5. **Synthesize Insights** - Combine perspectives for better understanding
6. **Check for Biases** - Identify cognitive distortions in reasoning

## Example Framework for Decision Making

```
DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. What are the mathematical probabilities and expected values?
2. What physics-like forces (inertia, momentum, feedback) are at work?
3. What biological/evolutionary patterns can be observed?
4. What psychological incentives and biases might affect outcomes?
5. What economic principles (opportunity cost, supply/demand) apply?
6. Where do these models reinforce or contradict each other?
7. What's the综合 (synthesized) view?
```

## Key Munger Principles

- "You must know the big ideas in the big disciplines and use them routinely"
- "Invert, always invert" - Think about what you want to avoid
- "Avoid extreme ideology" - Stay flexible in your thinking
- "Use checklists" - Systematize your decision process
- "Learn from mistakes" - Yours and others'
