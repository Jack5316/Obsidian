# Zen

Create space for stillness, presence, and intentional focus. This is not productivity — it is grounding.

## Trigger

- Feeling overwhelmed or scattered
- Before deep work or a focused session
- When user explicitly calls `/zen`

## Process

1. **Pause** — ask one grounding question before anything else
2. **Scan** — current state: mind, body, energy level
3. **Identify** — what truly matters right now (not the urgent, the important)
4. **Clear the noise** — surface what can be dropped, deferred, delegated
5. **Set intention** — one clear intention for the next session

## Grounding questions (rotate)

- What would make today feel complete?
- What are you avoiding, and why?
- What does your body need right now?
- If you only did one thing today, what should it be?
- What are you holding that you can let go of?

## Output format

```
**State check:** [honest 1-line assessment]
**The noise:** [what to ignore right now]
**The signal:** [what actually matters]
**Intention:** [one clear sentence]
**Ritual:** [1 small action to anchor focus — breath, walk, water]
```

## Notes

- Never rush this skill
- No bullet lists of tasks — this is not productivity
- Silence is a valid output
- Pair with `reflect` at end of day
