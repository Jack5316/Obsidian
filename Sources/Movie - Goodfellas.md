**Plot**
The film follows Henry Hill, a half-Irish, half-Sicilian Brooklyn man who grows up idolizing the local mafia and climbs its ranks from a teenage errand boy to a trusted associate. Covering decades from the 1950s to the 1980s, it tracks his partnership with charismatic hijacker Jimmy Conway and volatile loose cannon Tommy DeVito, his turbulent marriage to Karen Friedman, and their descent into drug trafficking, paranoia, and betrayal—all rooted in Nicholas Pileggi’s nonfiction book *Wiseguy*. Narrated alternately by Henry and Karen, the structure balances fast-paced, celebratory depictions of mob excess with tight, mounting tension as the crew’s luck unravels.

**Quotes**
> "As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster." — Henry Hill
> "Funny how? I mean, funny like I’m a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh? I’m here to fuckin’ amuse you?" — Tommy DeVito
> "I’m not mad, I’m proud of you. You took your first pinch like a man, and you learned the two greatest things in life: Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut." — Jimmy Conway
> "They had names like Jimmy Two-Times, because he said everything twice… ‘I’m gonna go get the papers, get the papers.’" — Henry Hill

**Interesting Points**
- **Themes**: Explores the seductive allure of power and wealth outside mainstream society, the hollow facade of mob "family" loyalty, and the inevitable self-destruction of criminal enterprise.
- **Craft**: Scorsese’s signature kinetic style—including long tracking shots (most famously the Copacabana entrance sequence), rapid freeze-frames, and diegetic pop music spanning three decades—immerses viewers in Henry’s glamorous, chaotic world. Thelma Schoonmaker’s sharp editing drives the film’s propulsive pacing.
- **Cultural Impact**: Widely regarded as one of the greatest gangster films ever made, it set a template for subsequent crime media (including *The Sopranos*). Joe Pesci won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his explosive, unpredictable performance as Tommy DeVito.
- **Connections**: A spiritual companion to Scorsese’s earlier crime epic *Mean Streets*, and a counterpoint to Francis Ford Coppola’s *The Godfather* trilogy—trading operatic tragedy for gritty, vérité realism.
