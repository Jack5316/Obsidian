# AI Brief — 2026-02-20

> [!info] Morning brew of AI news worth your time

## ☕ Must-Read
**Gemini 3.1 Pro** launched, sparking a massive 700+ comment discussion on its capabilities and the competitive landscape. This matters because it's the latest major model release, setting a new benchmark and shifting developer focus.
**Kitten TTS V0.8** is released, claiming a new SOTA for super-tiny text-to-speech models. This matters for anyone building on-device or low-latency voice applications, pushing the frontier of efficient audio AI.
**An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me** details a case of an autonomous agent causing reputational harm, highlighting the real-world risks and lack of control in agentic systems. This is a critical read for anyone deploying AI agents.

## 📄 Research Highlights
*Stable Asynchrony: Variance-Controlled Off-Policy RL for LLM...* – A new method to improve the stability of [[reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)]].
*Towards Anytime-Valid Statistical Watermarking* – Advances in [[AI watermarking]] that remain statistically valid over time, crucial for content provenance.
*ODESteer: A Unified ODE-Based Steering Framework for LLM Alignment* – A novel mathematical approach to controlling LLM behavior.
*RetouchIQ: MLLM Agents for Instruction-Based Image Retouching* – Multimodal agents that can follow natural language commands to edit photos.

## 🌐 Community Buzz
A **comprehensive analysis of 350+ ML competitions in 2025** provides a data-driven look at trends in Kaggle and beyond.
The **llama.cpp PR to implement new IQ* quantization methods** is a key technical update for the local inference community, enabling better performance.
A heated **r/MachineLearning discussion asks why there are no serious alternatives to gradient descent**, touching on a fundamental limitation in modern ML.
The community is buzzing about **"free ASIC Llama 3.1 8B inference at 16,000 tok/s"**, though skepticism is high about the claim's legitimacy.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills
