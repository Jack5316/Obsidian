# The OFFICIAL Notion Second Brain Setup

> [!info] 📺 [Tiago Forte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QDu6wpR59o) | 20:29 | 17,789 views

### Key Takeaways
- The system uses Tiago Forte’s PARA framework (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) as its core organization, with fluid movement between categories as priorities shift.
- Three interconnected databases—Tasks, Notes, and Read Later—link directly to PARA, creating an all-in-one tool for life management.
- Low-friction capture is critical: use a mobile-optimized quick capture page and Save to Notion web clipper to log ideas in under 30 seconds.
- A daily morning ritual (5–10 minutes) and weekly review (30 minutes or less) keep the system functional and clutter-free.

### Summary
#### Homepage & Quick Capture
The setup opens to a dashboard with left-side quick capture buttons, monthly priorities, quick references, and a weekly review checklist; the right side holds daily pages, task management, and the PARA system. A mobile-optimized page (favorited in the Notion app) enables one-column, low-friction capture for tasks, notes, or read-later items. The Save to Notion web clipper lets users save content directly to Notes or Read Later, with optional assignment to a PARA item.

#### Daily Ritual
A pre-built daily page template generates automatically each day. The morning ritual includes: renaming the page, tracking sleep/habits, working through a startup checklist (applying the 2-minute rule for small tasks), reviewing today’s to-dos and active projects, and using an open note space for random thoughts. A shutdown checklist helps wind down the workday.

#### PARA Framework
Tiago Forte defines PARA as:
- **Projects**: Short-term efforts with a clear end goal (e.g., "Toronto half marathon training"). Project pages include tabs for linked Tasks/Notes/Read Later, status toggles (Not Started → Inactive → Done → Archived), deadlines, and a project log. Built-in kickoff and completion checklists guide setup and wrap-up.
- **Areas**: Long-term responsibilities to maintain (e.g., "Travel," "Craft Maga self-defense"). These are often favorited for quick access and link to related projects/notes.
- **Resources**: Topics/interests for future use (e.g., "Sleep," "Improv classes"). Items can move fluidly between categories (e.g., a "Move into apartment" project becomes an "Apartment" area once moved in).
- **Archives**: Inactive items from any PARA category, kept accessible but out of sight.

#### Core Databases
- **Tasks**: Mimics dedicated task tools with views for Inbox (unprocessed tasks), Today, This Week, Waiting On, and Calendar. Tasks use both a *deadline* (final due date) and *do-on date* (day to work on it), plus tags for personal/work/offline/online. Recurring tasks are set via Notion’s recurring templates. A "Waiting On" status lets users track delegated items, with a one-click button to clear the field and reset status to In Progress.
- **Notes**: Stores processed knowledge with an Inbox for unassigned notes, plus statuses (Raw → Polished → Archived). Notes can link to multiple PARA items.
- **Read Later**: Captures unconsumed content (podcasts, YouTube, articles, books) with fields for content type, status (Not Started → In Progress → Done), link, recommender, and links to Notes/PARA.

#### Weekly Review
A 5-step checklist (built into the template) resets the system weekly: clear inboxes, process tasks/notes/read-later, review projects/areas, plan the next week, and reflect. It takes 30 minutes or less and ensures the system stays organized. Julia recommends scheduling it (e.g., Sunday evening, Friday afternoon, or Monday morning).

### Notable Quotes
- "For a second brain to actually work, you need to be able to capture things quickly and with as little friction as possible—because if it takes too long to capture something, you just won’t do it." (00:21)
- "PARA is the central organizational system that makes the second brain work. Tasks, notes, and read later are separate databases that all link to your projects, areas, or resources." (06:10)
- "Without maintenance, your second brain will get messier and messier... but the good news is 30 minutes or less a week is all it takes to reset your digital world." (18:13)

## Transcript

> [!abstract]- Full Transcript
> [00:00] I'm Julia Saxenna and I've been building
> [00:01] my second brain since [music] 2020. And
> [00:04] for the last four years, I've been
> [00:05] working with Thiago to teach this system
> [00:07] [music] to thousands of people across
> [00:09] the world. Stay with me for the next 20
> [00:11] minutes and [music] by the end you can
> [00:13] either build the second brain yourself
> [00:15] in notion or use [music] our template
> [00:18] that sets it up in just 5 minutes.
> [00:20] Here's what I'm going to show you. How
> [00:22] to capture any thought in about under 30
> [00:25] seconds and [music] plan your day in
> [00:27] just 5 minutes. how the power method
> [00:29] works and connects your task notes and
> [00:31] read later so you can really focus on
> [00:33] getting things done. And finally,
> [00:35] [music] how to maintain it all with a 30
> [00:37] minute weekly ritual. When I open my
> [00:40] second brain in notion, this is the page
> [00:43] I land [music] on. And this homepage is
> [00:45] split in a few sections and I'm just
> [00:47] going to show you what those are. So,
> [00:49] let's start here. On the left side, we
> [00:51] have our quick capture buttons, a place
> [00:54] where I put my priorities for this
> [00:57] month's, useful pages like a quick
> [00:59] reference guide, our notes, read later,
> [01:02] and then we have our weekly review
> [01:03] checklist. [music] On the bottom here,
> [01:05] some admin items that I can easily hide.
> [01:07] And then on the right side here are my
> [01:10] daily pages, my task management system,
> [01:13] and my power system divided [music] into
> [01:15] projects, areas, resources, and
> [01:17] archives. So, one of the biggest lessons
> [01:19] I've learned over the years is that for
> [01:21] a second brain to actually work, you
> [01:23] need to be able to capture things
> [01:25] quickly and with as little friction as
> [01:27] possible because if it is takes too long
> [01:29] to capture something, you just won't
> [01:31] [music] do it. You'll tell yourself
> [01:32] you'll remember it later, but you won't.
> [01:34] And that's how things start to fall
> [01:36] through the cracks. I try to abolish
> [01:37] friction completely in this system. So
> [01:40] to solve this, I built a separate page
> [01:43] which is fully optimized for mobile
> [01:47] viewing [music] and it's right here.
> [01:49] Everything is organized in one single
> [01:51] column with your action buttons at the
> [01:54] top followed by my task management parah
> [01:57] and then useful pages and weekly review
> [01:59] underneath it. So watch this. I've
> [02:01] simply added this page to my favorites
> [02:03] so I always open it in the notion mobile
> [02:06] app. So, let's say you want to just
> [02:08] quickly capture a new task [music] here
> [02:10] on my mobile page. I'm just going to
> [02:12] click quick capture button for task. Set
> [02:14] myself a reminder that I want to check
> [02:17] in for my flight. [music]
> [02:20] And I'm just going to set a deadline
> [02:22] here.
> [02:24] And done. So, the second way to quickly
> [02:27] capture into your second brain in notion
> [02:29] is [music] via a web clipper. And the
> [02:31] one I recommend is the save to notion
> [02:34] web clipper which is really the easiest
> [02:37] um to set up and operate. So I've set it
> [02:39] up in a way that I can either capture a
> [02:42] note or as an item that I want to read
> [02:45] later. So let's say here I'm on this
> [02:47] page of the art of accomplishment
> [02:49] podcast and they just published a new
> [02:51] podcast on the topic of perfectionism
> [02:53] which I should definitely learn more
> [02:55] about. And I'm [music] going to save
> [02:56] this to my read later database. So, I'm
> [02:58] just going to click here and [music]
> [03:00] just going to save the page and it's I
> [03:02] can choose if I want to open this page
> [03:04] now in notion and it's automatically
> [03:07] saved into my read later database.
> [03:09] [music]
> [03:10] Now, let's say I have something here.
> [03:12] I'm training currently for a half
> [03:13] marathon [music]
> [03:14] and I want to save this training plan. I
> [03:16] can again use my web clipper and this
> [03:19] time I'm going to save it [music] as a
> [03:22] note. So here I can assign
> [03:26] this to my Toronto half marathon
> [03:29] training project. But capturing is only
> [03:31] half the battle. You also need to know
> [03:33] how to use what you captured. And that's
> [03:36] where my morning ritual comes in. So
> [03:38] what do you do as a first thing when you
> [03:40] sit down at your computer in the
> [03:41] morning? [music] You may be jumping
> [03:43] right into your emails or Slack. Maybe
> [03:45] you read the news. But how you start
> [03:47] your day is incredibly important because
> [03:49] you can set yourself up for success or
> [03:52] failure. [music] So to ground myself,
> [03:54] the first thing I do is open my daily
> [03:56] page, which has been automatically
> [03:59] created for me through a recurring
> [04:02] template [music] here in my daily pages
> [04:04] database. The first thing I do is rename
> [04:07] the page and I also track my sleep. And
> [04:10] you can see here that I'm also tracking
> [04:12] um a couple of other items. And that's
> [04:14] how this daily pages database actually
> [04:17] functions as a great habit tracker as
> [04:19] well. Then I work through my startup
> [04:22] checklist which are a few items that
> [04:25] take just about maybe 5 to 10 minutes
> [04:27] and which helps me get settled for the
> [04:29] day and make sure I'm not forgetting
> [04:31] anything. And as I'm going through all
> [04:33] of these uh different uh places and
> [04:36] tools, I apply the 2minut rule. [music]
> [04:38] That means if there's anything to be
> [04:40] done that takes 2 minutes or less, I
> [04:42] will do it straight away. and just get
> [04:44] it off my plate. But if it takes longer,
> [04:46] then I'm just going to add it to my task
> [04:48] list. [music] So, the final item here is
> [04:50] really checking today's to-dos. And to
> [04:52] do that, I have a view of my [music]
> [04:55] task manager here that's set to today.
> [04:58] So, I can see what tasks are already
> [05:00] assigned [music] to this particular day.
> [05:03] I can also see this this week to see
> [05:06] what else is coming up this week. I can
> [05:09] see which items where I'm waiting on
> [05:11] someone else. um and even see like a
> [05:13] whole calendar view or even add other
> [05:15] views as well. Also, I have a toggle
> [05:17] with my active projects. [music]
> [05:18] So that way I can also see what's
> [05:21] currently on my plate. Which projects do
> [05:23] I want to work on today? What's a
> [05:25] priority right now? Further on this
> [05:28] page, I just have an open space for
> [05:29] notes. So usually I like to keep this
> [05:32] page open [music]
> [05:33] in a different tab. So that way I can
> [05:36] just add just random notes that I might
> [05:38] want to take throughout the day. just
> [05:39] it's a space for me just to return to to
> [05:42] get to get grounded before I start maybe
> [05:44] another another task. And finally, you
> [05:46] also see like a little shutdown
> [05:47] checklist here, which helps me wind down
> [05:50] at the end of my workday. So, when you
> [05:52] start your day like this, you're being
> [05:53] proactive instead of just reactive. And
> [05:56] by the way, everything I'm showing you
> [05:57] here is included in our second brain
> [05:59] notion template. If you want this exact
> [06:02] setup, link is in the description. Now,
> [06:04] you might be wondering where do all
> [06:06] these tasks and notes actually live. So
> [06:08] that's where PARA comes in. Parah is the
> [06:11] central organizational system that makes
> [06:13] the second brain work. Tasks, [music]
> [06:15] notes, and read later are separate
> [06:16] databases that all link to your
> [06:18] projects, areas, or resources. So I'll
> [06:21] let Thago himself explain what parah is.
> [06:24] >> Projects. These are the short-term
> [06:26] efforts in your work or life that you're
> [06:28] working on now. Areas. Areas are
> [06:30] long-term responsibilities you want to
> [06:32] manage over time. Resources. These are
> [06:34] topics or interests that may be useful
> [06:37] in the future. Finally, archives. These
> [06:39] are inactive items from any of the other
> [06:41] three categories.
> [06:42] >> And don't worry if you didn't remember
> [06:44] all that immediately. We have a
> [06:45] reference guide built in that reminds
> [06:47] you of the definitions of how power
> [06:49] works together with your task, notes,
> [06:51] and read later items. And it also
> [06:53] includes a quick decision tree to help
> [06:55] [music] you decide where to save the
> [06:56] information when you're getting started.
> [06:58] But you'll notice that it all becomes
> [07:00] second nature pretty quickly. Now, let
> [07:02] me show you what that actually looks
> [07:04] like in practice. Okay, so these are my
> [07:08] projects. When you open a project page,
> [07:11] at the very top of the page, you see
> [07:13] different tabs for the task, notes, and
> [07:15] read later items um assigned to this
