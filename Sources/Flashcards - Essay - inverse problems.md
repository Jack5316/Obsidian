What is a forward problem in linear algebra?::Given a system **A** and input **x**, compute the output **b = Ax** (mechanical, predictable).
What is an inverse problem in linear algebra?::Given an observed output **b**, find the input **x** that produces it (**b = Ax** → solve for **x**).
How do life decisions map to inverse problems?::We start with a desired life outcome (**b**) and work backward to find the choices (**x**) that get us there.
What are three key difficulties of inverse problems (in math and life)?::No solution exists, infinitely many solutions (analysis paralysis), or ill-conditioned (small shifts in desired outcome lead to wrong inputs).
What is Tikhonov regularization in math?::A method that favors solutions both close to the desired outcome *and* simple.
How can regularization be applied to life decisions?::Add constraints like simplicity bias, "do no harm" (keep options open), and values alignment to make the problem solvable.
How does the life inverse problem differ from the mathematical one?::In life, the system (matrix **A**) *changes* with our choices, and the desired outcome (**b**) also shifts over time—no "true" inverse, only approximations.
What is the core takeaway for life decisions from the inverse problem analogy?::Don’t seek a perfect input—look for a *regularized* one: simple enough to act on, aligned with values, and flexible as the problem evolves.
