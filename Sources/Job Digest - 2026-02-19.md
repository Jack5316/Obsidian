*   **Senior Site Reliability Engineer** (Ping Identity, USA)

*   **Associate Director Program Management** (Adverum Biotechnologies, Redwood City, CA)
    *   **Key Requirements:** Director-level role involving design, support, QA, strategy.
    *   **Note:** Senior biotech role, not China-relevant.

### Specialized Management
*   **Manager Tax Controversy** (Aprio, Remote)
    *   **Key Requirements:** Manager in consulting, technical support, growth.
    *   **Note:** Niche tax/consulting role, not China-relevant.

    *   **Key Requirements:** Manager for embedded, technical writing, support.
    *   **Note:** Technical content role, but not China-relevant.

## Summary & Actionable Insights
**China-Relevance:** None of the listed roles are based in or specifically target [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Hangzhou]], or offer remote-for-China arrangements. All are US-centric.

**Most Promising for a China Tech Focus:** **None.** This batch is heavily skewed toward US-based management and senior individual contributor roles in non-China markets. The SRE roles at Ping Identity are the most technically relevant for skills transfer, but location is a firm barrier.

**Cross-Domain Connections:** No direct links to [[AI]], chips, or philosophy. The roles are in identity management, biotech, tax, and payments—sectors with activity in China, but these specific listings are not positioned for that market.

**Recommendation:** This digest contains no viable opportunities for a job search in China. Focus should remain on platforms like V2EX for local listings or filter RemoteOK for "Worldwide" or "Asia" remote roles that may include China.
