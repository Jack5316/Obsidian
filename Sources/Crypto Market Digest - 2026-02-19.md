## Key Movers & Shakers
Both BTC and ETH are the primary movers today, given their outsized market share, but ETH is underperforming BTC slightly in the 24-hour session and significantly over the past 30 days. There are no smaller altcoins included in the provided data to highlight as additional movers.

## Risk Assessment
Risk levels are elevated for the crypto market at present. The steep 30-day drawdowns for both BTC and ETH signal sustained bearish momentum, with no clear near-term support levels confirmed from the provided data. Mild 24-hour declines offer little reassurance of a reversal, and investors should brace for continued volatility.
