# Chapter 1: Arrival

Lin Wan stepped off the high-speed train into Beijing South and the concourse hit her like a wall. The smell of instant noodles from a vendor stall mixed with diesel exhaust from the idling buses outside—the same combination she had forgotten, the way you forget a smell until you are inside it again. The PA system looped announcements in Mandarin, slightly distorted. 请各位旅客前往3号厅检票。The crowd moved in currents; she had to step sideways to avoid a man in a grey suit who was not looking at her. The soles of her shoes stuck briefly to the floor—cleaned that morning, already filmed with tracked-in grime. She stood with her suitcase and pressed her thumb into her palm. She had arrived. The word did not fit. She was still in transit.

She had taken the 73 bus to Gower Street for two years. The bus had stopped at Warren Street. The low rumble before the doors hissed open. She had learned the rhythm. The Cruciform Building's red brick against grey London sky. The quad had been the centre. The keyboard clatter in the library—muted, rhythmic. The sound of belonging through work. She had known the route by heart. Euston Square to Gower Street. Seven stops. Twelve minutes in traffic. She had timed it. She had never been late. Beijing rain smelled different—more dust, less decay. She stood in the concourse and the contrast was physical. None of that here. The station had no quad. The station had no library. The station had vending machines and a Starbucks and the smell of instant noodles. She had arrived with a suitcase and a degree. She had not arrived with belonging. Belonging had to be built. Or chosen. She had not yet learned how to do either.

A woman in a red coat brushed past her, dragging a wheeled bag. The bag caught Lin Wan's ankle. The woman did not stop. The crowd flowed. Lin Wan stepped back against a pillar. The pillar was cold. The concourse stretched. She had read that Beijing South was one of the largest railway stations in Asia. She had not felt the scale until now. The scale was in the bodies. The scale was in the sound. The PA system announced another train. 请各位旅客前往3号厅检票。The Mandarin was familiar. She had spoken it with her mother on the phone. She had spoken it with Ye Ming when they were teenagers. She had not spoken it in a crowd like this for two years. In London she had spoken English. In the seminar rooms. In the library. In the shops on Gower Street. The 73 bus had carried students who spoke Mandarin to each other. She had heard it. She had not always joined in. She had never fully joined the Chinese student society. She had built her belonging through merit. Through the work. Through the degree. The degree was in her bag. The certificate. The transcript. She had brought them. She had thought she would need them for job applications. She had not known that "UCL, MSc" on a CV would be one of many. She had not known that the sight of replaceability would be so immediate. She pressed her thumb into her palm. The pressure point. The habit. She would need it here.

She was one of thousands. The UK was the dominant source for returnees at 39.7 percent. She had read that. Australia was 17.1 percent. The US was 8.6 percent. Job-seeking returnees had increased 7 percent in 2024 versus 2023. She was part of a trend. The concourse stretched in both directions. Fluorescent lights flattened the faces of the crowd. She passed a row of vending machines, a Starbucks, a vendor selling roasted sweet potatoes. The smell of the sweet potatoes mixed with the instant noodles. She had not eaten since the train. She did not stop. She found a bench near the ticket gates and opened her phone. Thirty-seven unread messages. Her mother had sent twelve. The most recent: 到了吗？工作找得怎么样了？Lin Wan had not told her that she had applied to seventeen positions in the two weeks before leaving London. Three had replied. One had said they would take another look. She had not told her mother that the Graduate visa would have given her two more years in the UK—£880 application fee, £1,035 per year for the healthcare surcharge, a decision that typically took eight weeks. She had not told her mother that she had chosen to return anyway. The choice had felt like agency. Standing in Beijing South, it felt like something else.

She replied to her mother: 到了。一切顺利。She did not add anything about the job search. Her mother had replied: 工作找得怎么样了？有面试吗？Lin Wan had typed: 还在找。刚到。Her mother: 好。注意身体。有事跟妈妈说。Lin Wan had not replied further. She would tell her when she had news. Good news. The kind of news that justified the investment—the tuition, the visa fees, the two years away. Her family had funded it. Her younger brother had stayed. He had a job in Hangzhou. He had not needed to leave to prove himself. She had been the smart one. The one who got out. Returning felt like failure before she had even started. She pressed her thumb deeper into her palm. The pressure point. A small, private sensation. The body's response to dislocation. The habit had started during her first viva, when the examiner asked a question she had not prepared for. She had pressed her thumb into her palm and answered. She had passed. The habit had stayed.

The subway to Chaoyang took forty minutes. Line 10. The three-tone chime when the doors closed—higher pitch than London, faster rhythm. She stood in the crush of bodies. Shoulder against shoulder. The intimacy of strangers. A man in a puffer jacket had stepped on her foot. He had not apologized. She had not expected him to. The subway carried her. She carried her suitcase. She carried the degree. She carried the doubt. The doubt was new. She had not carried it in London. She had carried certainty. The certainty of the Cruciform. The doubt had arrived with the rejection emails. The train had rattled through the tunnel. The lights had flickered. The advertisements had blurred past—real estate, education, mobile plans. The same categories. The same promises. She had looked at her reflection in the dark window. The face had been familiar. The context had not. She had booked a short-term rental—seven nights, paid in advance. The building had no lift. She carried her suitcase up four flights. The stairwell smelled of cooking oil and mildew. The steps had been narrow. The suitcase had bumped against the wall. Someone had left a bicycle on the landing. She had had to squeeze past. The room was small: a single bed, a desk, a window that looked out onto another building's wall. The air conditioner hummed—a low, mechanical rattle that did not quite mask the television through the partition. She set her laptop on the desk and opened the job portal. The blue light of the screen filled the dim room. The keyboard was warm under her fingers. She had applied to that consulting firm five days ago. The portal still showed: Under Review. She refreshed. Under Review. She closed the tab. The degree had not opened that door.

She had applied to seventeen positions before leaving London. A 2017 study had found overseas graduates received fewer callbacks than domestic degree holders. She had told herself 2024 data showed a shift. Half of employers offered returnees better compensation. She had told herself she would be in that half. She refreshed the portal one more time. The status had changed. We regret to inform you that we have decided to pursue other candidates at this time. Thank you for your interest. The email had arrived while she was on the train. She had not seen it until now.

She read the sentence again. The words did not change. Pursue other candidates. She had tailored the cover letter. She had mentioned the dissertation. She had mentioned the Cruciform. The email had arrived at 14:32. She had been somewhere between Jinan and Tianjin. The train had been moving. She had not known. The day before, a recruiter had called. She had not answered in time. The voicemail had said: "Lin Wan? This is HR from the consulting firm. We've reviewed your application. Unfortunately we've decided to move forward with other candidates. Thank you for your interest. We'll keep your CV on file." She had listened twice. She had not called back.

She opened the other rejection emails. Two more. The same polite language. She had tailored each cover letter. UCL, MSc Economics, dissertation, coursework. The CV had looked strong in London. Here, recruiters had seen hundreds of CVs. "UCL, MSc" appeared on many. She closed the laptop. The room was dark except for the streetlight leaking through the thin curtains. The smell of the room—cheap detergent, the particular staleness of a space that was not hers—settled in her throat.

Seventeen applications. Three responses. All negative. The silence from the rest was its own response. She had paid for seven nights. She had one night left before she would need to decide. Stay. Find another room. Or accept Ye Ming's offer. She had wanted to prove she could do this alone. The proof was failing.

That night she could not sleep. The smell of the room was unfamiliar—cheap detergent, the particular staleness of a space that was not hers. The sublet was someone else's space. Previous tenants' soap. Someone else's furniture. The zone was unknown. She lay in the dark and thought about the Cruciform Building. Grade II-listed red brick. Medical and life sciences. She had studied there in her final term—the library on the third floor, the hushed keyboards, the knowledge that a UCL degree meant something. UCL ranked ninth globally. The viva had lasted forty minutes. The examiner had asked a question she had not prepared for. She had pressed her thumb into her palm and answered. The habit had started then. She had passed. She had walked out of the room. The quad had been empty. The streetlights had cast long shadows. In London, that had meant something. Here, she did not yet know what it meant. The room was dark. Beijing in January. The cold cut differently than London—drier, sharper. She pulled the blanket over her shoulders. The blanket carried the shape of strangers. The television through the wall had gone quiet. The building had settled. The sound of traffic had softened to a distant hum. She had checked her phone. No new emails. No messages. Her mother had sent 到了吗？ again. She had not replied. She would apply again tomorrow. The degree had to mean something. She had repeated it to herself until the words had lost their shape. The degree had to mean something. She had fallen asleep with her thumb in her palm.

The second day she applied to twelve more positions. She had run the numbers. To maintain the same standard of living she had had in London would cost 65,430 yuan per month. In Beijing, 25,000 yuan could achieve a similar lifestyle. She had no income. Her savings would not last at London-level spending. They would not last at any level of spending if the job search stretched to six months. She had read that 35 percent of returnees required three to six months to find employment. She had been in Beijing for one week. She had a long way to go. She applied to consulting firms. She applied to financial institutions. She applied to education and training companies—the sector absorbed 32.7 percent of returnee positions. She had not considered teaching. She considered it now. The roles were there. The responses were not. She had tailored each cover letter. She had changed the opening paragraph for each company. She had changed the closing. She had kept the middle the same. UCL. MSc. Dissertation. The CV had been the same. She had sent the applications. She had waited. The blue light of the screen. The hum of the air conditioner. The room was small. The window looked out onto another building's wall. She had no view. She had no job. She had a degree from a university that ranked ninth globally. The degree had not opened any doors. She would keep applying. The alternative was unthinkable. Return to Hangzhou. Live with her mother. Admit the investment had failed. She would not do that. Not yet. Not until she had tried everything. Her mother had called that evening. She had not answered. She had let it ring. Her mother had left a voice message. Lin Wan had listened. "晚晚，到了吗？吃饭了吗？工作找得怎么样？妈担心你。有空回个电话。你弟弟说北京竞争大，你要是累了就回来。杭州也有机会。妈不是催你，妈就是——你一个人那么远。"

She had texted: 在忙。明天再说。

Her mother had replied: 好。注意身体。钱够不够？

Lin Wan: 够。妈，我没事。

Her mother: 有事跟妈妈说。别硬撑。妈晚上睡不着就想你。

Lin Wan: 知道了。妈，我会的。

Her mother: 好。妈等你消息。

She had not replied to that. She had put the phone face down. She had applied to three more positions. She had gone to bed at midnight. She had not slept until two.

Ye Ming messaged the next morning. 听说你回来了。有空一起吃饭吗？She had known him since they were teenagers in Hangzhou. He had stayed. Tsinghua undergraduate, Peking University MBA. Asset management at a state-owned financial institution. Twenty-two thousand yuan a month. A flat in Chaoyang that he had bought with family help. She had not seen him in three years. She replied: 好。明天？

The café was in Chaoyang. Lin Wan had looked it up. She had taken the subway. Line 10. The three-tone chime. The crush of bodies. She had arrived early. She had ordered coffee. She had not wanted to owe him for the drink. He had arrived and ordered for both of them anyway. The bill had gone to his card. She had not protested. She had not had the energy. The coffee had been bitter. The café was on the ground floor of an office building. Through the window she could see the uniform blocks of apartment towers, some lit, some dark. Ye Ming arrived in a navy blazer. He looked older. He had always looked older—the kind of person who seemed to have figured things out before anyone else. He ordered for both of them. Coffee for her, tea for him. When the drinks arrived, he stirred his tea and did not quite meet her eyes.

"Your mother asked me to look after you," he said.

"I can look after myself."

"I know." He nodded. The nod was familiar. He had done it when they were sixteen and she had told him she was applying to UK universities. As if he had already understood and was waiting for you to catch up. It read as confidence; it sometimes read as dismissal. The imbalance was visible. He had a job. A flat. A network. She had none. "But if you need anything—contacts, a place to stay—just say. 没事，我来."

She had heard that phrase before. It's fine, I'll handle it. He had said it when her bicycle chain broke on the way to school. When she had needed someone to vouch for her at the bank. He filled silences with action. She had left to escape that. Not him—the expectation that someone would always be there to fix things. "再说吧," she said. We'll see.

He did not push. "How's the job search? Really."

"Like I said. I'm still getting oriented."

"Lin Wan. I can tell when you're deflecting."

"I'm not deflecting. I'm surviving. There's a difference."

"Okay. I won't push. But if you need—"

"I know. I'll ask. When I need to."

He had nodded. He asked about London. "What was it like? The two years?"

"Quiet. I spent most of my time in the library. The Cruciform Building. Red brick. You'd like it."

"Red brick. Very British."

"Very." She had stirred her coffee. "The 73 bus. Zone B hall. £239 a week. I learned the route by heart."

"And the people? Did you make friends?"

"Some. I didn't join the Chinese student society. Not really. I wanted to—" She had stopped. She had not wanted to say integrate. She had not wanted to say belong. "I wanted to focus on the work. The degree."

"Always the work. Even in London."

"Especially in London. That was the point. To prove I could do it. To prove the degree meant something."

"And now?"

"Now I'm proving it again. Different city. Same proof."

He had nodded. "What did you write about? Your dissertation."

"Labour market outcomes. Domestic versus overseas degrees. Callback rates."

"Interesting. And the conclusion?"

"That it's complicated. Half the employers prefer returnees. Half don't. The data was mixed."

"Mixed." He had repeated the word. "So you came back knowing it was mixed."

"I came back because I wanted to." She had not said because she had run out of visa options. She had not said because her mother had asked. "I wanted to contribute here."

"And now?"

"Now I'm here." She had stirred her coffee. "The job market. Applications. The usual."

"The usual. How many positions have you looked at?"

"A few. I'm still getting oriented."

"Lin Wan. I can help. My friend at the consulting firm—they're hiring. I could make an introduction."

"I know. I'll apply. I want to do it myself first."

"Yourself first." He had nodded. "Always."

"Not always. Just—this. I need to know I can do this."

"And if you can't?"

"Then I'll ask for help. But not yet."

He had not pushed. She had not elaborated. She had told him about the quad at dusk, the streetlights casting long shadows, the sound of London persisting—distant sirens, a bus on the main road—while the campus went quiet. She had built her identity there. The identity was being tested now. She did not tell him about the first rejection—the polite email that had arrived that morning. Thank you for your interest. We have decided to pursue other candidates. The role had been entry-level. She had thought she was overqualified. "UCL, MSc Economics" on the CV. No callback.

"How's the job search going?" he asked.

"Fine."

"Really?"

"The market's competitive. I've only just started." The lie sat between them. She had applied to seventeen positions. Three had replied. All negative.

"How many have you applied to?"

"Enough."

"Lin Wan."

"Seventeen. Before I left. Three replied. All negative." She had not meant to say it. The words had come out. Her coffee had gone cold.

"That's—that's rough. How long have you been back?"

"Two weeks. Almost three."

"And nothing since?"

"Four more rejections. This week. The rest don't reply."

"Lin Wan. That's not—you're not—" He had stopped. "You're good. You know you're good. The market's just—"

"Just what? Brutal? I wrote my dissertation on it. I know the numbers."

"I know you know. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to—"

"It's fine. I didn't mean to dump it on you."

He nodded. His spoon clicked against the side of his cup. The sound was precise. The café had filled around them. Office workers on lunch break. A woman in a suit typing on a laptop. The sound of the espresso machine. The smell of roasted beans. Ye Ming had not touched his tea. He had stirred it once. The spoon had made a small sound against the porcelain.

"I have a friend at a consulting firm. They're hiring. I could introduce you."

"再说吧."

He looked at her. This time his eyes met hers. The nod had been his default. The eyes meeting hers was not. "Lin Wan. You don't have to do everything alone."

She had heard that before. From her mother. From the career advisor at UCL. The help Ye Ming offered was contacts. A room. The infrastructure of belonging he had built without leaving. She had left. She had built something else. The something else was being tested. "I'll manage," she said.

"Where are you staying?"

"A short-term rental. Chaoyang. Seven nights."

"And after that?"

"I'll find something." She had not found anything. The average new graduate earned 6,199 yuan six months after graduation. She had no income. Her savings would not stretch.

He was quiet for a moment. The espresso machine hissed. "The spare room at my place is empty. If you need it. Temporary. Until you find something."

"Thank you. I'll manage." She had said it twice now. She would say it again. The phrase was a wall.

"Your mother said you're not answering her calls."

"She calls. I text back."

"She worries."

"I know." She had pressed her thumb into her palm under the table. "I'll call her when I have news."

"What kind of news?"

"Job news. Good news."

He had nodded. He had not asked what she would do if the good news did not come. She had not known the answer herself. "Your brother's settled. In Hangzhou. Your mother mentioned he's looking at flats."

"I know. She texts me about it."

"Does that—"

"Sometimes it stings. He stayed. He has a job. He didn't need a UCL degree to prove anything." She had not meant to say it. "Not his fault. Just the comparison."

"I stayed too. Different path. Same city. I'm not saying it's the same. But you're not the only one who chose something and has to live with it."

"She calls. I text back."

"She worries."

"I know." She had pressed her thumb into her palm under the table. "I'll call her when I have news."

"What kind of news?"

"Job news. Good news."

He had nodded. He had not asked what she would do if the good news did not come. She had not known the answer herself.

He paid the bill. She did not offer to split it. Her savings in yuan would last two months if she was careful. The job search would take longer than she had told her mother. Thirty percent of returnees were still jobless at three months. Twelve point seven million graduates entering the market in 2026. She was one of them.

Three days later, the short-term rental expired. She had applied to twenty-three more positions. Four rejections. The rest: silence. She had not found another room she could afford. The average new graduate earned 6,199 yuan six months after graduation. She had no income. Her savings would not stretch to another week in the sublet and the job search. Ye Ming had offered his spare room. Temporary, he had said. Until you find something. She had refused. She had wanted to prove she could do this on her own. She messaged him: 你之前说的那个房间，还方便吗？

He replied within minutes. 方便。我下班去接你。

He met her at the subway station at six. He had left work early. He had carried her suitcase. The flat was in a building with a lobby and a doorman. The building was newer than her sublet. The lobby had marble floors. The doorman had nodded. Ye Ming had nodded back. The elevator had mirrors. She had seen herself in them. The same face. The same suitcase. The same uncertainty. The elevator had climbed. The numbers had lit. 5. 8. 10. 12. The doors had opened. The corridor had been quiet. The flat had been at the end. He had handed her the key. Cold metal. The key had been cold. The flat had been warm. The smell of rice. The smell of someone who lived here. She had stood in the doorway. She had not known what to say. Thank you had not been enough. Thank you had been all she had.

"The spare room is through there. Bathroom's shared. Make yourself at home."

"How long—" She had stopped. She had not wanted to ask. Asking made it real.

"As long as you need. Seriously. I'm not using it."

"I'll find something soon. A few weeks, maybe."

"Lin Wan." He had set her suitcase down. "There's no rush. 没事，我来."

"I don't want to be a burden."

"You're not. You're a friend who needs a place to stay. I've had friends crash here before. It's fine."

"For how long? A week? A month?"

"Until you find something. Or until you want to leave. Whatever comes first."

"I'll pay you back. When I have a job."

"You don't have to."

"I will. I don't want to owe—" She had stopped.

"You don't owe me anything. Just focus on the job search. That's the only thing that matters right now."

She had heard it again. The phrase. She had not corrected him. She had nodded. "Thank you."

"I mean it. No rent. No timeline. You focus on the job search."

"I'll pay you back. When I have something."

"You don't have to."

"I will." She had meant it. The debt would sit between them until she could clear it. "I applied to twenty-three more positions this week. Something will come through."

"Twenty-three. In one week. That's—"

"That's what it takes. I read that 35 percent need three to six months. I'm not there yet. I'll keep going."

"Okay. I believe you. Just—eat. Sleep. Don't burn out."

"I won't. I can't afford to."

"Twenty-three. In one week."

"The market's competitive. You have to keep applying."

He had looked at her. "You're tired."

"I'm fine."

"Lin Wan. You're not fine. You don't have to be fine. Just—stay. Apply. We'll figure it out."

She had not known what to say to that. She had nodded. She had carried her suitcase into the spare room.

She had not wanted to accept his offer. She had wanted to prove she could do this alone. The proof was failing. The numbers were failing. Seventeen applications. Then twenty-three more. Three responses. Then four rejections. All negative. The silence from the rest was its own response. She had taken the crack in the door. She would not forget that she had needed it.

The flat was tidy. Books on the shelves. A rice cooker on the kitchen counter. Laundry detergent in the bathroom. The smell of someone who lived here—rice cooker steam, laundry detergent, the faint trace of a life that was maintained. Ye Ming had a life. A job. A flat with his name on the lease. Beijing mid-level professionals earned fifteen to twenty-five thousand yuan a month. He was doing well. She stood in the doorway of the spare room. A double bed. A desk. A window that looked out over Chaoyang's high-rises at dusk. The uniform windows, some lit, some dark. His success was visible in every object. The books were economics and finance. The same subjects she had studied. The difference was that his books sat on shelves he owned. In a flat he owned. In a city where he had never had to prove he belonged. She had left to become someone. She had become someone in London. Here, she was a guest in his spare room. The path he had taken—domestic education, domestic career, domestic belonging—was the path she had not taken. Tsinghua. Peking University MBA. Asset management. State-owned financial institution. The flat was warm. The heating worked. In her sublet the heating had been unreliable. She had worn a coat indoors. Here, the coat was unnecessary. She was a guest. She would not forget that.

"Thank you," she said.

"没事，我来." He was already in the kitchen, filling the kettle. "Dinner in an hour? I'll order something."

"You don't have to—"

"I'm ordering anyway. You can join or not." The kettle clicked on. The sound of water beginning to boil. "What do you want? Dumplings? Noodles?"

"Whatever you're having."

"Okay." He had not looked at her. He was already on his phone, scrolling. The domestic ease of it. The flat was his. The routine was his. She was the variable. "Lin Wan. Eat. You look tired."

She had not known what to say to that. "I've been applying. A lot."

"How many?"

"Forty. Forty positions. Since I arrived."

"Forty." He had put the phone down. "And?"

"Four rejections. The rest: silence."

"Silence."

"That's how it works. They don't reply. You keep applying."

"Have you tried the consulting firm? The one I mentioned?"

"I haven't applied yet."

"Why not?"

"Because I wanted to do it myself first." She had heard the edge in her voice. "I'll apply. If they're still hiring."

"They're still hiring. I checked last week. Lin Wan—"

"I know. I'll apply. Tomorrow. I promise."

"Okay. Dumplings it is. Eat. You look tired."

He had nodded. "And the consulting firm? My friend's—"

"I haven't applied yet."

"Why not?"

"Because I wanted to do it myself first." She had heard the edge in her voice. "I'll apply. If they're still hiring."

"Okay." He had picked up his phone again. "Dumplings it is. Lin Wan. Eat. You look tired."

She had nodded. She had gone to unpack.

She unpacked. She had brought two suits, five blouses, her laptop, her CV. She had printed twenty copies before leaving London. She had used three. The rest sat in her bag. She opened her laptop and pulled up the job listings. The Ministry of Education had gathered over twelve million openings since autumn 2025. Employment expansion and quality improvement. The banners at the job fairs said that. The listings blurred. Entry-level roles at firms she had never heard of. Senior roles that required five years of experience. She had targeted consulting. Economics. She had the degree. Over 60 percent of returnees in foreign and private firms occupied mid- to senior-level management roles. She had expected to enter at a higher level. The roles she was seeing were entry-level. The roles that responded were fewer.

She scrolled. The weight of the laptop on her knees. The flicker of the screen. She had not known what it would feel like to be one of 12.7 million. The number had been abstract. A statistic. Now it was the scroll of listings. The scroll of companies she had never heard of. The scroll of roles that required three years of experience when she had none. She had clicked on a listing. Analyst. Consulting. The requirements had listed: bachelor's degree, two years experience, proficiency in Excel. She had had a master's. She had had no experience. She had applied anyway. She had clicked on another. The salary had been 8,000 yuan. She had closed the tab. She had kept scrolling. The degree felt like a mask. She was still wearing it. Waiting for someone to recognize it. No one had. In London, the Cruciform Building had been a landmark. The red brick against grey sky. She had belonged there. She had earned it. Here, belonging was not earned. It was given. Or withheld. The city did not owe her anything. She had read that the Ministry of Education had gathered over twelve million job openings since autumn 2025. Employment expansion and quality improvement. The banners at the job fairs had said that. The openings had existed. The openings had not been for her. Or they had been for her and thousands of others. The difference had not mattered. She had been one of many. She had closed the laptop. The room was dark. Ye Ming had not turned on the overhead light. The city glowed through the window. She could hear the refrigerator in the kitchen. The sound of traffic, distant. In London, silence in the library had been productive—the silence of concentration, of belonging. Here, silence meant she was waiting. The absence of an offer letter was the sound of not yet having arrived. She pressed her thumb into her palm. She would apply again tomorrow. She would wait again. The flat held her until morning.

The third day in Ye Ming's flat she applied to fifteen positions. Two rejections by evening. The rest: silence. She had learned to expect silence. She tailored each cover letter. UCL. MSc. Dissertation. She had not listed the doubt. She had not listed the fear. The fear that she was ordinary. The fear that the degree was a mask. She had read that 47.9 percent of returnees exhibited moderately severe depressive disorder. Reacculturation carried a significant mental health toll. She had not wanted to become a statistic. She had applied to a fintech company. She had applied to an education startup. She had applied to a state-owned enterprise. The fintech had wanted Python. She had learned Python in her first year. She had not used it since. She had applied anyway. The education startup had wanted teaching experience. She had none. She had applied anyway. The state-owned enterprise had wanted a Party member. She was not. She had applied anyway. The applications had been a form of hope. The hope had been a form of survival. She had survived another day. She had applied to a real estate company. She had applied to a logistics firm. She had applied to a healthcare startup. The roles had been tangentially related to economics. The roles had been a stretch. She had stretched. She had closed the laptop. The screen had gone dark. The room had been lit only by the streetlight. She had made tea. She had sat by the window. Ye Ming's flat had looked out over Chaoyang. The uniform blocks. Some lit. Some dark. She had not known which windows held people like her. People waiting. People applying. People pressing their thumbs into their palms. She had not been alone. The knowledge had been cold comfort. The knowledge had been comfort nonetheless. She made tea. She sat by the window. The city glowed. The uniform blocks. Some lit. Some dark. She would apply again tomorrow. The flat held her. Ye Ming had come home late that night. She had heard the key in the lock. She had heard him in the kitchen. She had not gone out. She had not wanted to talk. She had wanted to be alone with the silence. The silence had been the sound of waiting. The silence had been the sound of not yet having failed. She had applied again the next morning. She had applied to five more positions. She had received one rejection. She had applied again.

The second week was harder than the first. The novelty had worn off. The gratitude had curdled into something like resentment. She had not wanted to resent him. She had resented the situation. She had resented that she needed his help. She had resented that he had a life when she did not. The flat had been a mirror. It had shown her what she did not have. Tsinghua. PKU. Asset management. Never having left. She had left. She had returned. She had the degree. She did not have the job. She did not have the flat. She did not have the belonging. She had said thank you. She had meant it. She had also resented it. The contradiction had lived in her chest. She would carry it until she had a job. Until she had a room. Until she had something of her own. She would show up anyway.

She had read about the Graduate visa before leaving. Two years of unsponsored work if she applied before 31 December 2026. She could have stayed. She could have worked at any skill level. The application fee was £880. The healthcare surcharge was £1,035 per year. The decision typically took eight weeks. She had chosen to return instead. She had told herself it was time. She had told her mother it was time. The phone calls had grown more frequent. When will you come home? When will you find a job? When will you settle down? The questions had collapsed into one. She had chosen to return before the questions became demands. The choice had felt like agency. Standing in Ye Ming's flat, scrolling job listings, it felt like something else. She had wanted China to choose her. She had not known that China did not owe her anything. She had not known that she would have to choose China even when China did not choose her back. She was learning.

# Chapter 2: The Gate

Weeks three through six in Beijing had passed in a blur of applications and silence. Lin Wan had stopped counting rejections. She had started counting applications sent. Fifty-three. Sixty-seven. Eighty-two. The numbers climbed. The responses did not. Only 30 percent of returnees secured employment within three months. 35 percent required three to six months. She had read that. She had been in Beijing for five weeks. She was approaching the three-month mark. She had not wanted to become a statistic. She had not wanted to be one of the 30 percent. The statistics had not asked what she wanted. She had attended one job fair. She had collected brochures. She had handed over CVs. The recruiters had taken them with the same expression. Polite. Non-committal. She had learned to read that expression. It meant nothing. It meant everything. It meant she was one of thousands. The Ministry of Education had gathered over 12 million job openings since autumn 2025. Employment expansion and quality improvement. The banners had said that. The queues had delivered doubt. She had met Zhou Xiao there. She had added her on WeChat. She had not heard from her since. She had been in Beijing for five weeks when Ye Ming's contact had come through. The consulting firm. An interview. A chance. She would make it count.

The consulting firm was in a glass tower in Chaoyang. Lin Wan had applied through Ye Ming's contact—she had accepted the introduction after all, when the silence from her other applications had stretched to three weeks. She had not wanted to accept. She had wanted to prove she could do this on her own. The silence had proven otherwise. Fifty-three applications. Sixty-seven. The numbers had climbed. The responses had not. Ye Ming's contact had been a crack in the door. She had taken it. The lobby had marble floors. The security guard had checked her ID. The elevator had required a key. She had waited for someone to hold the door. A man in a suit had nodded. She had stepped in. The elevator climbed. The reflection in the polished metal showed her: navy suit, hair pulled back, the face she had rehearsed in the mirror. Professional. Composed. The elevator had mirrors on three sides. She had seen herself from multiple angles. The same face. The same uncertainty. The numbers had lit. 5. 8. 10. 12. 15. The doors had opened. The corridor had been quiet. The receptionist had looked up. She had directed Lin Wan to a waiting room. She sat in a chair that was synthetic, slightly sticky in the stuffy warmth of the climate-controlled room. The air conditioning hummed. No one else was waiting. A potted plant had stood in the corner. The leaves had been dusty. The magazine on the side table had been six months old. The silence was different from the Cruciform library. In London, silence had been productive. The silence of concentration. The silence of belonging through work. Here, silence meant she was being evaluated. The next candidate would sit in the same chair. The room would not remember her. She had learned that. She had learned it in the first round of rejections. She had learned it in the job fair. She had learned it in the crush of 12.7 million. The receptionist had called her name. "Lin Wan?"

"Yes."

"Please follow me. Ms. Xu will see you in a moment."

"Thank you."

"Can I get you water? Tea?"

"Water, please. Thank you."

She had stood. She had followed the woman in the blazer. The corridor had been quiet. The doors had been closed. The firm had felt like a place that had made decisions. The decisions had not included her. Not yet. She had walked. She had breathed. She had prepared.

She had researched the firm. Mid-tier. Hired returnees and domestic grads. The HR manager was Xu Qing. Lin Wan had not met her. She had only seen the name on the interview confirmation. The door opened. A woman in a blazer, her hair in a low bun. She carried a folder. "Lin Wan? I'm Xu Qing. Please follow me."

The interview room had no window. Overhead lighting flattened everything. The chair was synthetic. Slightly sticky in the stuffy warmth of the climate-controlled room. She had sat in chairs like this before. Career fairs. Mock interviews. The UCL careers service had run mock interviews. She had practised. She had received feedback. The feedback had been positive. The difference was that there, the degree had meant something. The mock interviewers had known UCL. They had known the ranking. Here, the room was designed to put you at ease and keep you off-balance. You could not read the outcome. The room would not remember her. The next candidate would sit in the same chair. Xu Qing sat across the desk. Lin Wan's CV lay between them. Xu Qing's fingers found something in her blazer pocket—a fountain pen. She did not use it. She had not taken notes during the interview. But her fingers kept returning to it. A tell. Lin Wan had learned to watch for tells. Xu Qing had a tell. Her fingers found the fountain pen when she was deciding something.

"Tell me about your experience at UCL," Xu Qing said.

"Two years. MSc Economics. I wrote my dissertation on labour market outcomes for returnees. Callback rates. Domestic versus overseas degrees."

"And your undergraduate?"

"Zhejiang University. Economics. I went to the UK for the master's."

"Zhejiang. Strong school. Why UCL specifically?"

"The programme fit. The ranking. I wanted to understand international labour markets. The dissertation topic came from that."

"Callback rates. What did you measure?"

"Response rates to job applications. Same role, same qualifications. Domestic degree versus overseas. I controlled for sector, experience, gender."

"And the sample?"

"Twenty-twenty to twenty-twenty-four. Five thousand applications. Matched pairs."

"Interesting. And why that topic?"

"I wanted to understand the gap. The perception gap. What employers see when they look at a CV from someone who studied abroad."

Xu Qing's expression had not changed. "And what did you find?"

"That the gap had narrowed. 2024 data showed a shift. Half of employers offered returnees better compensation. But the 2017 study—fewer callbacks—still influenced perception. The methodology was regression analysis. I used a dataset of callback outcomes from 2020 to 2024."

"Relevant to what we do here. We advise clients on talent strategy. Returnee hiring is a recurring theme." Xu Qing had paused. "And the Cruciform? You studied there?"

"The library. Third floor. I spent most of my final term there. The keyboard clatter. The particular silence. It was—" She had stopped. She had not wanted to sound nostalgic. "It was productive."

"What made it productive?"

"The structure. The routine. You knew what you were there for. No one questioned it. The degree meant something. To the examiners. To the other students. To yourself."

"And here? In Beijing?"

"Here it's different. The degree means something different. Or nothing. I'm still learning which."

"Honest answer." Xu Qing's fingers had touched the fountain pen. "Why did you leave London? You could have stayed. Graduate visa. Two years of work."

"I chose to return. Family. And I wanted to contribute here. To use what I learned."

"Contribute how?"

"Analytical work. Market research. The skills transfer. I understand the Chinese market. I also understand how international firms evaluate talent. I can bridge that." She had rehearsed this. The UCL careers service had drilled it.

Xu Qing nodded. "What's your biggest weakness?"

"I can be too self-reliant. I prefer to figure things out alone. But I've learned that collaboration matters. Especially in consulting."

"And your biggest strength?"

"Persistence. I don't give up when something is hard."

Xu Qing's fingers had found the fountain pen. "How would you handle a client who doesn't trust overseas-educated consultants?"

"I'd listen first. Understand the concern. Then demonstrate value through the work. Trust is earned. Not assumed."

"Good answer." Xu Qing had not smiled. "What are your salary expectations?"

"I'm flexible. I'm focused on growth and learning the market first."

"Flexible can mean many things."

"Fifteen to twenty thousand. Base. I've researched the market. Beijing mid-level bands. I'm open to discussion depending on the full package."

"Benefits matter to you."

"Social insurance. Housing fund. Growth path. The base is one part. I want to understand the whole picture."

Xu Qing had made a note. The first note of the interview. "We have many strong applicants," she said. "We'll take another look." 我们再看一下。

"Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity."

"Thank you for coming in. Your dissertation topic—it's relevant. We'll be in touch."

"May I ask—what's the timeline for the next step?"

"Two weeks. If we move forward, you'll hear from HR. If not—we don't always send rejections. Volume is high."

"Understood. Thank you."

The phrase was non-committal. 我们再看一下。We'll take another look. Lin Wan had heard it from other recruiters. It had been non-committal when they had said it. She had stood. She had extended her hand. Xu Qing had shaken it. Her grip had been firm. Her eyes had met Lin Wan's. For a moment, Lin Wan had thought she had seen something. Recognition. Or its opposite. She had not been able to read it.

"Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you."

"Thank you for coming in. We'll be in touch."

Xu Qing had nodded. She had not said anything else. Lin Wan had left. The chair was synthetic. Slightly sticky. She had sat in chairs like this in London—career fairs, mock interviews. The difference was that there, the degree had meant something. Here, Xu Qing had seen hundreds of CVs. "UCL, MSc Economics" appeared on many. Warwick. LSE. Oxford. Cambridge. The UK was the dominant source. 39.7 percent. Xu Qing had returned from Warwick. She had taken six months to find her first role. She knew the gap between the degree on paper and the person in the chair. She had become the person who evaluated that gap. The sight of replaceability. The corridor outside was empty. The air conditioning hummed. She did not know if she had passed or failed. She knew only that the room would not remember her. The next candidate would sit in the same chair. Xu Qing's fingers had found the fountain pen three times during the interview. Each time, Lin Wan had wondered: pass or filter? She would not know until the email arrived. Or did not arrive. The silence would tell her.

She took the subway back to Ye Ming's flat. The city moved around her. She had no idea what Xu Qing had decided. The evaluation had felt personal—not just professional. She had seen something in Xu Qing's face. Recognition. And something else. Something that made Xu Qing colder, not warmer. Rush hour. The three-tone chime. The crush of bodies. She stood with her back against the door. The reflection in the window showed the faces of strangers. Young. Old. Tired. Hopeful. A woman in a suit had been reading a report. A man had been on his phone. A student had been wearing headphones. She had looked at her own reflection. The navy suit. The hair pulled back. The face she had rehearsed. She had not known if it had been enough. The train had stopped. The doors had opened. More people had crowded in. The crush had tightened. She had held the pole. The metal had been cold. She had expected her degree to open doors. The doors had stayed closed. The gap was personal now. It was also structural. She would keep applying. She would keep showing up. She would wait for Xu Qing's decision. She would not know until the email arrived. Or did not arrive. The train had arrived at her stop. She had stepped onto the platform. The crowd had carried her toward the exit. She had climbed the stairs. The street had been cold. Beijing in January. She had walked to Ye Ming's building. The doorman had nodded. She had nodded back. She had taken the elevator. The numbers had lit. She had stood in the corridor. She had taken out her key. Her phone had rung. Her mother.

Her phone rang as she reached the flat. Her mother. Lin Wan stood in the hallway. The key in her hand. She answered. "妈。"

"晚晚，工作找得怎么样了？" Her mother's voice. The familiar weight. "还有那个叶明，你们见面了吗？他妈妈说你住在他那里了。"

Lin Wan pressed her thumb into her palm. She had not told her mother she was staying with Ye Ming. Her mother had found out through Ye Ming's mother. The network of family friends carried news faster than she could control it. "见了。工作还在找。"

"面试怎么样？有消息吗？"

"今天刚面了一家。说再等等。"

"再等等。" Her mother's tone shifted. Lin Wan could hear the television in the background. A variety show. Laughter. "晚晚，你弟弟都稳定了。在杭州，房子也看了。你一个人在北京，妈不放心。"

"I'm fine. I have a place to stay."

"叶明那里？"

"嗯。暂时的。找到工作就搬。"

"叶明那孩子不错的。你考虑考虑。" Her mother's voice softened. "工作慢慢来。有他帮忙，你也不用太着急。"

"再说吧," she said.

"晚晚——"

"妈，我这边还有事。先挂了。"

"你吃饭了吗？"

"吃了。" She had not. She had not had an appetite since the interview. "妈，我挂了。"

"钱够不够？"

"够。"

"真的够？"

"真的。妈，我没事。"

"你弟弟说北京竞争大。他说你要是累了就回来。杭州也有机会。"

"我知道。我还没累。"

"晚晚，妈不是催你。妈就是担心。你一个人那么远。叶明那里住得习惯吗？"

"习惯。他挺好的。"

"叶明那孩子不错的。他妈妈跟我说了。你考虑考虑。工作慢慢找。人要紧。"

"妈，工作的事我会搞定的。先不说了。"

"好。有事跟妈妈说。别硬撑。妈晚上睡不着就想你。"

"我知道。妈，我会找到的。再给我一点时间。"

"好。注意身体。"

She ended the call. The phone screen went dark. She had not told her mother about the interview. She had not told her that she did not know if she had passed. The flat was quiet. Ye Ming was at work. She stood in the hallway. The key still in her hand. The smell of the hallway—someone's cooking, garlic and ginger—drifted from under a neighbour's door.

The job fair was at the China International Exhibition Center. Lin Wan had registered online. She had brought twenty CVs. She had worn her navy suit. Line 10 to the exhibition center. The crowd had been different from the usual commute. Younger. Dressed in interview clothes. Clutching folders and CVs. She had known, standing on the platform, that she was one of them. 12.7 million graduates. The boat was crowded. A woman next to her had been rehearsing her introduction under her breath. She had not realized Lin Wan could hear. "Good morning. I am a recent graduate from—" The train had arrived. The doors had opened. The crush had carried them in. The hall was vast. Fluorescent lights flattened everything. The ceiling had been high. The space had swallowed sound and returned it as echo. The PA system looped announcements in Mandarin. 请各位毕业生前往3号厅。The sound was a wall: overlapping conversations, the shuffle of feet, the rustle of paper. The smell was disinfectant and sweat and the faint chemical tang of new plastic—lanyards, folders. She moved through the crowd shoulder-to-shoulder. Booth banners competed for attention. Red and gold. Corporate logos. Slogans about employment expansion and quality improvement. Over 12 million openings gathered since autumn 2025. The banners promised. The queues delivered doubt. The touch was the brush of strangers. The weight of her CV stack. The stickiness of synthetic flooring underfoot. The temperature was too warm. Too many bodies. The air did not circulate. She had not felt it until now. The feeling was the crush. The feeling was the hope and the despair coexisting. The feeling was being one face in a crowd. She had passed a booth for an EV manufacturer. The queue had been fifty people long. She had kept walking. She had passed a booth for a battery technology company. The queue had been longer. She had found a consulting booth. The queue had been shorter. She had joined it. She had waited twenty minutes. The recruiter had taken her CV. He had not looked at it. He had placed it on a stack. The stack had been six inches high.

"UCL. Economics. Any consulting experience?"

"No. I have analytical skills. Market research. My dissertation was on labour market outcomes."

"Labour market. What aspect?"

"Callback rates. Domestic versus overseas degrees. Employer perception."

"Relevant. We advise on talent strategy. Returnee hiring comes up." He had flipped through her CV. "When did you graduate?"

"Last summer. I've been applying since I returned."

"How many positions?"

"Over fifty. So far."

"Fifty." He had placed her CV on the stack. "We get hundreds. We'll review. Leave your contact. We'll be in touch."

"Thank you. Is there a timeline?"

"Two to three weeks if we're interested. No response means we've moved on."

"Understood. Thank you."

"One more thing. Salary expectations?"

"Fifteen to twenty. I'm flexible."

"Noted." He had handed her a brochure. He had not looked at her again. She had known, standing there, that he would not remember her face.

She had brought twenty CVs. She had used five by noon. The recruiters took them with the same expression. Polite. Non-committal. She had seen the stacks on their desks. Hundreds of CVs. White paper. Black text. Headshots in the corner. "UCL, MSc" appeared on many. She was one of 12.7 million. The scale of competition was not abstract. It was the crush of bodies. The smell of sweat. The sight of graduates waiting in lines that did not move. The touch of synthetic flooring underfoot. The brush of strangers. The weight of her CV stack. The air did not circulate. Too many bodies. Too warm. She had read that youth unemployment hovered around 17 percent. One in five young people could not find work. She had not felt that statistic until now. She felt it in the density of the crowd. In the way the recruiters' eyes glazed over. In the knowledge that she was replaceable.

She found a space near a pillar. She was checking her phone when a woman approached. Younger. Mid-twenties. She spoke quickly, as if she was afraid the listener would leave before she finished. "Renmin University. Economics. You?"

"UCL. MSc Economics."

"Ah." The woman nodded. She had a stack of brochures. "I'm Zhou Xiao. We're in the same boat." She handed Lin Wan a card. "WeChat? Maybe we can share leads."

Lin Wan took the card. "How many have you applied to?"

"Eighty-three. This week." Zhou Xiao laughed. It was not a happy sound. "I've had four interviews. Nothing yet. You?"

"About the same." Lin Wan had not said the number. She had not wanted to compare. "The consulting booths are packed."

"Everything's packed. Did you see the EV manufacturing queue? Two hours. I gave up." Zhou Xiao shifted her folder. "Where did you study? London?"

"Two years. UCL. Economics."

"UCL. Nice. I never had the chance. Family couldn't afford it." Zhou Xiao said it without bitterness. A fact. "Sometimes I wonder if it helps or hurts. The overseas degree. Employers look at you differently."

"I've wondered the same thing. I wrote my dissertation on it. Callback rates. Domestic versus overseas."

"Really? What did you find?"

"That it's complicated. Half the employers prefer returnees. Half don't. The 2017 study said we get fewer callbacks. The 2024 data said we get better compensation. Nobody knows what to believe."

"Nobody knows what to believe." Zhou Xiao had repeated it. "That's the whole job market. 12.7 million of us. Nobody knows anything."

"Exactly."

"What's your target? Salary-wise?"

"Fifteen to twenty. I'm flexible."

"Same. I'd take twelve if it meant something stable. My parents are asking when I'll move out."

"Mine too."

"At least you have UCL. That might open doors."

"Maybe. Hasn't yet."

"Add me. If you hear about anything—analytics, consulting, whatever—let me know. I'll do the same."

"I will. And if you hear anything—consulting, analytics—let me know too."

"Deal." Zhou Xiao had smiled. It had been a tired smile. "Good luck. We're going to need it."

"Good luck. How long have you been looking?"

"Three months. Same as everyone. My parents keep asking when I'll move out. Yours?"

"Same. The questions. When will you settle down. When will you have news."

"News. As if we're not trying."

"As if." Lin Wan had looked at the crowd. "Do you ever wonder if the degree helps or hurts? UCL. Renmin. Does it matter?"

"Sometimes I think it hurts. Employers look at you and think: she'll leave. She'll want too much. She doesn't know how things work here."

"I've thought that too. I wrote my dissertation on it. Still don't know the answer."

"Nobody does. We're all guessing." Zhou Xiao had shifted her folder. "Which firms did you try today?"

"Consulting. Finance. Internet. The usual."

"Same. The recruiter at the consulting booth—did he even look at your CV?"

"No."

"Me neither. Just stacked it. 12.7 million. We're all numbers."

"Numbers."

"What's your target? Salary-wise?"

"Fifteen to twenty. I'd take twelve if it meant something stable."

"Same. I've lowered mine twice. Started at twenty. Now I'd take fifteen. Still nothing."

"At least we're not alone. That's something."

"Is it?"

"Maybe not. But it's something. Add me. Seriously. We might need each other."

"Okay." Lin Wan had opened WeChat. "Done."

Lin Wan added Zhou Xiao on WeChat. Zhou Xiao had a domestic degree. Renmin University. A strong school. Not UCL. Not international. No overseas experience. No "foreignness" to explain. A 2017 study had found that overseas graduates were less likely to receive callbacks than domestic degree holders. Rising quality of Chinese education. High salary expectations. Zhou Xiao might have an advantage. Or she might not. The employers were ambivalent. Half offered returnees better compensation. Half did not. The 2024 data had shown a shift. Lin Wan had read that. She had hoped it was true. They were rivals. They could also be allies. 12.7 million graduates. The boat was crowded. Lin Wan could not yet see that. She saw only that Zhou Xiao was younger. Twenty-four. She had said so. Hungrier. Willing to take roles Lin Wan might consider beneath her. Entry-level. The average graduate earned 6,199 yuan six months out. Zhou Xiao might accept that. Lin Wan had an MSc. She had expected more. She had begun to lower her expectations. The shift was not triumphant. It was survival. She collected more brochures. She felt smaller with each booth. The recruiters' eyes had glazed over. The stacks of CVs had grown. White paper. Black text. Headshots in the corner. "UCL, MSc" had appeared on many. She had been one of many. She had read that youth unemployment hovered around 17 percent. One in five young people could not find work. She had not felt that statistic until now. She felt it in the density of the crowd. In the way the recruiters' eyes glazed over. In the knowledge that she was replaceable.

She had visited booths for EV manufacturing, battery technology, consulting, internet, finance. She had left her CV at each. She had received business cards. Promises to review. Nothing concrete. At the internet company booth, the recruiter had asked about her experience with AI. "Do you have any AI or machine learning experience?"

"I studied economics. I have analytical skills. I've used Python for data analysis."

"Python. What level?"

"Data analysis. Regression. Basic scripting. I used it for my dissertation dataset."

"We're looking for more technical profiles. ML models. Deep learning. But leave your CV. We'll review. Sometimes we have analyst roles."

"Thank you. Is there a timeline?"

"Two weeks. Same as everyone. We get hundreds of CVs."

"Understood. Thank you."

"One more thing. Where did you study?"

"UCL. Economics."

"UK. Good. We hire returnees sometimes. Competition's fierce. We'll be in touch."

He had placed her CV on the stack. He had not looked at it again. At the finance booth, the queue had been shorter. The recruiter had been a woman. "Salary expectations?"

"I'm flexible. Fifteen to twenty thousand. Base."

"Flexible. Good." The woman had written something down. She had not said what. "We have many applicants. We'll be in touch. What's your timeline? When did you graduate?"

"Last summer. I've been applying since I returned from the UK."

"UK. UCL?"

"Yes. Economics."

"Good school. We hire returnees. But competition is fierce. We'll be in touch."

"Thank you. May I ask—how many positions are you filling?"

"Three. For this cohort. We had over two hundred applications last week."

"Understood. Thank you."

She had handed Lin Wan a brochure. She had said they would be in touch. The job fair was where hope and despair coexisted. She had not stood out. She had been processed. By three o'clock the hall had not emptied. The crowd had thinned. The recruiters had looked tired. The stacks of CVs had grown. She had passed Zhou Xiao again. Zhou Xiao had been at a different booth. She had waved. Lin Wan had waved back.

"Any luck?" Zhou Xiao had called over the crowd.

"Nothing yet. You?"

"Same. The finance booth said they'd review. Standard line."

"I know. I've heard it twenty times today."

"At least we're not alone. That's something."

"Is it?"

"Maybe not. But it's something. Add me. We'll survive this."

"I already did. This morning."

"Right. Good. We'll survive. 加油！"

"加油。你也是。"

They had not spoken more. The moment had passed. The crowd had carried them apart.

She left the job fair at four. She had not received an offer. She had expected to feel like she was making progress. She felt like she was standing still. The subway took her back to Chaoyang. The train had been less crowded. She had found a seat. She had looked at the brochures. She had put them in her bag. She had arrived in Beijing with a degree from a university that ranked ninth globally. She had left with brochures and the knowledge that she was one of many. Zhou Xiao had said it: We're in the same boat. Lin Wan was beginning to see it now. The boat was crowded. The boat was not sinking. The boat was simply full. She would have to find a place in it. Or build one. She had not yet known how. The train had stopped at her station. She had climbed the stairs. The street had been cold. She had walked to Ye Ming's building. She had not wanted to go back empty-handed. She had wanted to have news. She had wanted to have an offer. She had had neither. She had gone back anyway. The flat had been warm. Ye Ming had been at work. She had made tea. She had opened her laptop. She had applied to three more positions. She had applied to the firms whose brochures she had collected. She had applied to the companies whose recruiters had taken her CV. She had known the applications would join the stacks. She had applied anyway. The applying had been the only thing she could do. She had done it. She would do it again tomorrow. And the next day. And the day after. Until something changed. Or until she changed. She had not known which would come first. She had known she would not stop. Not yet. Not until she had tried everything.

The days had passed. Lin Wan had applied to more positions. She had received more rejections. She had received more silence. The consulting firm had not responded. Xu Qing had said "we'll take another look." The phrase had been non-committal. It had always been non-committal. Lin Wan had stopped checking her email every hour. She had stopped expecting. She had not stopped hoping. The hope was a small, persistent thing. It lived in the space between applying and waiting. It lived in the space between the person she had been in London and the person she was becoming in Beijing. She had met Zhou Xiao at the job fair. She had added her on WeChat. She had not heard from her since. She had wondered if Zhou Xiao had found something. She had wondered if she was the only one still searching. A week later, Zhou Xiao posted on WeChat: 拿到offer了！感谢大家！Lin Wan had been in Ye Ming's spare room. She had been applying to positions. She had seen the notification. She had opened it. She had read the post. She had read it again. Zhou Xiao had applied to the same firm. A mid-tier consulting company. Lin Wan had interviewed there once. She had left with "we'll take another look." Zhou Xiao had gotten the offer. Domestic degree. No overseas experience. No "foreignness" to explain. The 2017 callback study made flesh. Lin Wan sat in Ye Ming's spare room. The plastic chair from the interview waiting room had been replaced by the desk chair. The buzz of her phone with the news. She had not yet decided how to feel. Envy. Respect. Or both. She had not yet texted congratulations. She had not yet admitted that Zhou Xiao had won something she had wanted. The gatekeeper's logic was opaque. Xu Qing had seen hundreds of CVs. She had chosen Zhou Xiao. Lin Wan did not know why. She did not know if she would ever know. Perhaps Zhou Xiao had interviewed better. Perhaps the domestic degree had been an advantage. Perhaps it had been luck. The strong hiring sectors were electric vehicle manufacturing, battery technology, AI and software development. She had studied economics. She had not studied engineering. She had not studied AI. The mismatch was structural. She could pivot. She could apply to roles that required analytical skills. She had those. The consulting firms wanted analytical skills. She had applied. The responses had been silence. Or rejection. The job fair had been a reminder. 12.7 million graduates. She was one of them. Zhou Xiao was one of them. Zhou Xiao had made it. Lin Wan had not. Not yet. The "yet" had been the only thing that had kept her from closing the laptop and not opening it again.

Ye Ming came home that evening. He had brought dinner. The smell of the food filled the flat. Rice cooker steam. Takeout containers. The flat had smelled of rice before. It always smelled of rice. He had a rice cooker. He used it. The smell was the smell of someone who lived here. Of someone who had a routine. Of someone who had arrived.

"I heard from my friend. The consulting firm. They're still considering you. They might have another round."

"Zhou Xiao got the offer. I applied to the same place."

Ye Ming set the food on the table. He did not look at her. His hands moved with purpose. Plates. Chopsticks. Napkins. The table was small. The flat was small. It was also his. Every object was his. The plates. The chopsticks. The view of Chaoyang.

"Who's Zhou Xiao?"

"Someone I met at the job fair. Domestic degree. Renmin. She got the offer. I didn't."

He was quiet. He served the rice. The steam rose between them. "That doesn't mean you're out. They might have multiple positions."

"Maybe." She had not wanted to hope. Hope had cost her too much already. "I'll keep applying."

"How do you feel?"

"About Zhou Xiao?"

"About any of it."

She had not expected the question. "I don't know. Envious. Resentful. Also—she worked for it. She applied to eighty-three positions. Same boat."

"Same boat."

"We're all in the same boat. 12.7 million of us. She got out. I haven't."

"Does it make you want to give up?"

"Sometimes. Then I apply to five more positions. Then I feel slightly less like giving up."

"Lin Wan."

"I'm fine. I'm not fine. Both. I'll keep going."

"There are other firms. I have another contact. At an asset management company. 没事，我来."

She had heard that phrase before. It's fine, I'll handle it. He had said it when she had moved in. When he had offered to introduce her to his friend. When her bicycle chain had broken when they were sixteen. When she had needed someone to vouch for her at the bank. He filled silences with action. His hands were always moving. Always doing. She wanted to scream: I need you to listen, not fix. She did not scream. She said, "I'll apply to more positions myself."

"Lin Wan. You don't have to do everything alone."

"I know. But when you say 没事，我来—it doesn't help. I need to do this myself. Or at least feel like I'm doing it myself."

He looked at her. Really looked. His chopsticks had paused. "What would help?"

"I don't know. Just—not fixing. Not always fixing. Sometimes I need you to sit with it. With me. Without doing anything."

"Sit with it."

"Yeah. The not knowing. The waiting. You always have an answer. A contact. A solution. Sometimes there isn't one."

He was quiet. The rice steamed between them. "I'm not good at that. Sitting. Not doing."

"I know. You've always been the one who fixes things. The bicycle. The bank. It's who you are."

"Is that bad?"

"No. It's just—not what I need right now. Not always."

He nodded. He did not say 没事，我来. He did not offer another contact. He said, "Okay. I'll try. To just—listen."

"Thank you."

He picked up his chopsticks. "Eat. The food's getting cold."

She ate. The food was good. She could not taste it. But something had shifted. He had listened. For a moment, he had listened. She had pulled away from him. She had begun to avoid his calls. She had stopped telling him the truth. When he asked how the job search was going, she said fine. She had applied to roles she once considered beneath her. Entry-level. Lower salary. The average undergraduate graduate earned 6,199 yuan six months out. She had an MSc. She had expected more. She had stopped measuring herself by the roles she deserved. She had started measuring by the roles that might respond. The shift was not triumphant. It was survival. It was the knowledge that she could not control fit, perception, luck. She could only control how many applications she sent. How many times she showed up. How long she could hold out before the savings ran out.

She applied to fifteen more positions that week. She received two rejections. The rest: silence. She had stopped expecting the consulting firm to respond. Xu Qing had said "we'll take another look." That had been three weeks ago. The silence had stretched. She was one of the 30 percent. Still jobless at three months. She had not told her mother. She had not told Ye Ming. She had told herself she would keep applying. She would find something. The degree had to mean something. She was not sure she believed it anymore.

The email arrived on a Tuesday morning. She was in Ye Ming's flat. She had made instant coffee. The taste was bitter. The granules had not fully dissolved. She had stirred them with a chopstick. The subject line: Second Round Interview—Consulting Analyst Position. She read it twice. The firm wanted to see her again. They had not rejected her. They had not chosen Zhou Xiao over her—or they had chosen both. Or they had opened another position. She did not know. She did not care. The callback had arrived. Xu Qing had made a choice. She had passed Lin Wan through. The pen in her blazer pocket. The moment of decision. Lin Wan had not seen it. She had only seen the result. She had read the email a third time. The date. The time. The address. The same building. The same floor. The same room. She would sit in the same chair. She would answer the same questions. She would hope for a different outcome. The weight of knowing she could be filtered at any moment sat in her chest. She would prepare. She would perform. She would not know until the end whether it was a second chance or a mistake. She had been one of the 30 percent. Still jobless at three months. The callback was a crack. She would push through. She replied to confirm. She pressed her thumb into her palm. Then she released it. She would try again. The coffee had gone cold. She had drunk it anyway.

She had not told Zhou Xiao congratulations. She would do it when she had news of her own. Zhou Xiao had gotten the offer. Lin Wan had gotten a callback. The difference was a chasm. The difference was also a bridge. The callback was a crack in the door. She would push through.

That night she researched the firm again. She prepared answers. She prepared questions. The preparation was a form of control. She could not control the outcome. She could control how she showed up. She had read the firm's website. She had read about their recent projects. She had prepared three questions to ask. She had rehearsed her answers. She had rehearsed the salary question. She had rehearsed the "why did you return" question. She had rehearsed until the words had felt familiar. The flat was quiet. Ye Ming had gone to bed. She had heard his door close. She had heard the silence. She sat in the spare room. The city glowed through the window. The uniform blocks. Some lit. Some dark. She would make it count. She had to make it count. The callback had been a crack. She would push through. She had closed the laptop. She had lain in the dark. She had not slept for a long time. She had thought about Zhou Xiao. She had thought about Xu Qing. She had thought about the fountain pen. She had thought about the next candidate. She had fallen asleep with her thumb in her palm. She had woken at six. She had made tea. She had put on the navy suit. She had taken the subway. She had arrived. She would make it count.

# Chapter 3: The Dark Night

Lin Wan returned to the consulting firm for the final round. She had taken the subway. Line 10. The same route as the first interview. The crowd had been lighter. It had been a Tuesday. Mid-morning. She had arrived fifteen minutes early. She had waited in the lobby. She had not wanted to wait in the lobby. She had wanted to go straight up. The receptionist had said to wait. She had waited. The elevator climbed. The reflection in the polished metal showed her: the same navy suit, freshly pressed. The same face. Professional. Composed. She had rehearsed her answers. She had researched the firm's recent projects. She had prepared questions to ask. She had done everything right. The outcome was not in her hands. The outcome was in Xu Qing's hands. The gatekeeper held the key. She had learned that. She had learned it in the first round. She had learned it when Zhou Xiao had gotten the offer. She had learned it in the silence that had stretched for weeks. The gatekeeper's logic was opaque. Xu Qing had seen hundreds of CVs. She had chosen Zhou Xiao. She had chosen to give Lin Wan a second round. The reasons were not visible. The power was not in Lin Wan's hands. She could only perform. She could only show up. She could only hope that the performance was enough. The elevator had stopped. The doors had opened. The corridor had been the same. The waiting room had been the same. The chair had been the same. She had sat. She had waited. She had been called. She had stood. She had followed Xu Qing to the interview room. She had sat. She had begun. The room had smelled of air conditioning and old carpet. The overhead light had hummed. Xu Qing had opened the folder. She had looked at Lin Wan. She had asked the first question. Lin Wan had answered. She had kept her voice steady. She had kept her hands still. She had not pressed her thumb into her palm. Not yet. She had saved that for later. For the silence. For the waiting. For the not knowing.

The interview room was the same. No window. Overhead lighting. The synthetic chair. Slightly sticky. The air conditioning hummed. Xu Qing sat across the desk. Her fingers found the fountain pen in her blazer pocket. She was deciding something. Lin Wan answered the questions. She spoke about her dissertation. She spoke about her understanding of the Chinese market. She spoke about why she had returned. She did not say she was desperate. She did not say she had been jobless for three months. She did not say she was one of the 30 percent. She did not say she was living in Ye Ming's spare room. She did not say the degree felt like a mask. She performed. She performed well. Or she did not. She could not read Xu Qing's face.

"Salary expectations?" Xu Qing had asked.

"I'm flexible. I'm focused on growth and learning the market."

"Flexible can mean many things."

"Fifteen to twenty-five thousand. Base. I've researched the market." Beijing mid-level professionals earned fifteen to twenty-five thousand yuan a month. She had not said she would take anything. She had not said she was running out of options.

Xu Qing had nodded. Her fingers had returned to the fountain pen. "And if we offer below that?"

"Then I'd want to understand the full package. Benefits. Growth path." She had rehearsed this. The UCL careers service had drilled it. Never say you would take anything. Never show desperation.

"Why should we hire you over a domestic graduate?"

"Because I've seen both sides. I understand how international firms evaluate talent. I can bridge that. And I want to be here. I chose to return."

"Chose to return." Xu Qing had repeated it. "Many returnees say that."

"I know. But it's true. I could have stayed. I didn't."

"Any questions for us?"

"What does success look like in the first year? For this role."

"Learning the clients. Delivering clean analysis. Fitting the team." Xu Qing had paused. "We value persistence. We value people who show up."

"Anything else I should know about the team? The culture?"

"We're a mix. Domestic and returnee. Different backgrounds. We've had both work well and both fail. Fit matters."

"Understood. Thank you."

Lin Wan had nodded. She had not said she had been showing up for three months. She had not said she had applied to 127 positions. The chair was synthetic. The air conditioning hummed. Xu Qing's fingers returned to the fountain pen three times. Each time, Lin Wan wondered: pass or filter? She would not know until the email arrived. Or did not arrive. The silence would tell her.

When the interview ended, Xu Qing stood. "We'll be in touch. We have a few more candidates to see. You'll hear from us within two weeks."

"Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity."

"We appreciate you coming in. Your dissertation topic—it's relevant to our work. We advise clients on talent strategy. Returnee hiring comes up often."

"I'd be glad to contribute to that. If you decide to move forward."

"We'll be in touch." The same phrase. Non-committal. Lin Wan had stood. She had extended her hand. Xu Qing had shaken it. Her grip had been firm. Her eyes had met Lin Wan's. "Thank you for your time," Lin Wan had said.

"Thank you for coming in. Safe journey home."

Xu Qing had nodded. She had not said anything else. Lin Wan had left. The corridor was empty. The elevator doors closed. The reflection of her face—professional, composed—in the polished metal. She had done everything she could. The rest was waiting. The silence would stretch. She knew that. She had learned that. In Beijing, silence after an interview meant you had been dismissed. Or it meant you were still being considered. The silence was the sound of not knowing. She took the subway back to Ye Ming's flat. The three-tone chime. The crush of bodies. The city moved around her. She did not move with it. She was suspended. Waiting. The flat was empty when she arrived. Ye Ming was at work. She sat in the spare room. The window looked out over Chaoyang. The uniform blocks. Some lit. Some dark. She was one of the 30 percent. Still jobless at three months. The statistic had become personal. She had not wanted it to be personal. It was. Only 30 percent of returnees secured employment within three months. Thirty-five percent required three to six months. She had passed the three-month mark. She was in the 35 percent. Or she was in the percentage that took longer. She did not want to think about how long longer might be. The average undergraduate graduate earned 6,199 yuan six months out. She had an MSc. She had expected more. She had applied to 127 positions. She had received 23 rejections. She had received 2 interviews. She had received 1 callback. She had received 0 offers. The numbers were a form of waiting. The waiting was a form of survival. She would survive. She would show up again. She would apply again. She would wait again. The choice to stay had been made before she knew the outcome. The outcome would come when it came. Or it would not. She would stay anyway. She had made tea. She had sat by the window. She had not opened her laptop. She had not wanted to apply. She had wanted to wait. The waiting had been its own kind of work. The waiting had required patience. She had not had much patience left. She had had enough. She had waited. The consulting firm had not responded that day. They had not responded the next day. They had not responded for a week. She had continued applying to other positions. She had received two more rejections. She had received nothing else. The silence had stretched. The silence had been the sound of not knowing. She had learned to sit with it. She had learned that the silence did not mean no. The silence meant not yet. Or it meant no. She had not known. She had chosen to believe it meant not yet. The belief had been a form of hope. The hope had been a form of survival. She had survived. She would survive. The email would come or it would not. She would show up anyway. She had shown up. She had done the work. The rest had been out of her hands. She had learned to accept that. The acceptance had been hard. The acceptance had been necessary. She had accepted. She had waited.

The days after the final round had stretched. Lin Wan had checked her email every hour. She had checked the spam folder. She had checked the job portal. Nothing. The silence had stretched to a week. Then two. She had continued applying to other positions. She had received two more rejections. She had received nothing else. The consulting firm had not responded. Xu Qing had said "we'll be in touch." The phrase had been non-committal. It had always been non-committal. Lin Wan had stopped expecting a response. She had not stopped hoping. The hope was a small, persistent thing. It lived in the space between checking her email and finding nothing. It lived in the space between applying and waiting. It lived in the space between the person she had been in London and the person she was becoming in Beijing. She had applied to the consulting firm through Ye Ming's contact. She had made it to the final round. She had performed. She had done everything right. The outcome was not in her hands. The outcome was in Xu Qing's hands. The gatekeeper held the key. Lin Wan could only wait. She could only show up. She could only keep applying. She had done all of that. The silence had stretched. She had become one of the 30 percent. Still jobless at three months. The statistic had become personal. She had not wanted it to be personal. It was. In the mornings she had made tea. She had sat by the window. The city had woken below. The uniform blocks. Some lit. Some dark. The traffic had built. The buses had moved. She had opened her laptop. She had applied to three more positions. She had closed the laptop. She had made more tea. Ye Ming had left for work. The flat had been quiet. The refrigerator had hummed. She had heard the elevator in the corridor. The neighbours had left. She had stayed. She had applied to five more positions the next day. She had received one rejection. The email had arrived at 4 p.m. She had read it standing in the kitchen. The kettle had been boiling. She had not noticed until the steam had burned her hand. She had not cried. She had pressed her thumb into her palm. She had applied again.

She had read about salary expectations. Salary satisfaction among Chinese job seekers had dropped to 22 percent in 2024. Seventy-eight percent had expected raises exceeding 10 percent. She had expected her degree to open doors. The doors had stayed closed. The gap was personal now. It was also structural. The feeling was the silence. The blue light of the screen. The weight of the laptop on her knees. Pressing her thumb into her palm when the email did not arrive. She would keep applying. She would keep showing up. She had no other choice. Or she had many choices. Return to the UK. Apply for the Graduate visa. Go back to Hangzhou. Live with her mother. Accept a role she had once considered beneath her. The choices were all difficult. The choice to stay in Beijing, to keep trying, was the one she had made. She would see it through.

Her phone buzzed. Lu Yuan. Her UCL classmate. Same cohort. He had stayed in London. The Graduate visa. Two years of unsponsored work. He had not returned. She opened the message. 晚晚！我升职了！Shoreditch的fintech，新办公室，团队也扩大了。北京怎么样？She stared at the screen. She had not replied to his last message. He had asked how Beijing was. She had said fine. She had not said she had no job. She had not said she was living in Ye Ming's spare room. She had not said the degree felt like a mask. She had not said she was one of the 30 percent. She had not said that 12.7 million graduates had entered the market and she was still waiting. She typed: 恭喜！北京还好。She sent it.

Lu Yuan: 有空来伦敦玩！

Lin Wan: 好，一定。

Lu Yuan: 工作找得怎么样？

She had paused. She had typed: 还在找。市场比较难。She had sent it. She had not said she was one of the 30 percent. She had not said she had applied to 127 positions. She had said enough.

Lu Yuan: 加油！有需要可以找我。

Lin Wan: 谢谢。

Lu Yuan: 伦敦这边机会挺多的。你要是想回来，我可以帮你问问。我们公司也在招人。

Lin Wan: 暂时不回了。再试试北京。

Lu Yuan: 行。你决定。有需要说话。北京竞争大，我知道。

Lin Wan: 知道。没事。会找到的。

Lu Yuan: 好。谢了。保重。

Lin Wan: 好。谢了。

She had not meant the London invitation. She had not known when she would have the money. She had not known when she would have the time. She had put down the phone. She sat with it. The café was downstairs. She had not left the flat. She was still in the spare room. Lu Yuan's success was visible. New office. Promoted. His timeline was clear. Hers was not. She envied him. She pitied him. He had not yet had to face the question of belonging in China. He had chosen to stay. She had chosen to return. The road not taken. His updates stung. They had always stung. She had told herself she did not care. She cared. She pressed her thumb into her palm. The pressure point. The body's response to dislocation. He had not meant to hurt her. His message was well-meaning. How's Beijing? She had said fine. Fine was a lie. Fine was the only thing she could say. The Graduate visa had given him two years. He had used them. He had a job. A promotion. A life in London. She had let her visa lapse. She had chosen to return. The choice had felt like agency. Sitting in Ye Ming's spare room, jobless, the choice felt like something else. It felt like she had given up the safety net. It felt like she had to make it work here. There was no going back. She had not wanted to go back. She had wanted to belong here. The wanting had not been enough.

She went to a café that afternoon. She needed to leave the flat. Bitter coffee. The taste stayed in her mouth. The café had exposed brick and industrial lighting—the kind of place that could have been in Shoreditch. It was not. The menu was in Chinese. The prices were in yuan.

"Americano. Large."

"Hot or iced?"

"Hot."

"For here or to go?"

"For here."

"Anything else?"

"No. Thank you."

"Seat yourself. I'll bring it over."

"Thanks."

She had taken the cup. The barista had not asked if she was okay. She was glad. She would not have known what to say. "Need a receipt?"

"No. Thanks."

She had taken the cup to a corner table. She had opened WeChat. Lu Yuan had posted a photo. The new office. White walls. Plants. His life in London. She had left that life. She had chosen to return. Sitting in the Beijing café, jobless, the choice felt like something else. The road not taken. His success was visible. Hers was not. She pressed her thumb into her palm. The cold of the window glass against her forehead. The café was warm. The window was cold. Beijing in February. The contrast was physical.

She was ordinary. The degree had been a mask. She had worn it in London. It had fit. Here, it did not fit. Zhou Xiao had a job. Zhou Xiao had a domestic degree. Lin Wan had UCL. Lin Wan had nothing. The comparison was not fair. The comparison was all she had. A 2024 study had found 47.9 percent of returnees exhibited moderately severe depressive disorder. She could become one of them. Or she could choose not to. The choice to stay—to keep applying, to keep showing up—was the only thing she could control. She would make that choice. She would make it again tomorrow. She had read that behavioral adaptation and positive coping reduced depression. Social withdrawal increased it. She had chosen to adapt. She had chosen not to withdraw. The coffee had gone cold. She had not noticed. She had raised her hand. "Another Americano. Same."

"Large?"

"Yes."

The waiter had nodded. He had not asked if she was okay. She was glad. She would not have known what to say. She had looked at the other customers. A man in a suit. A woman with a laptop. A couple sharing a cake. They had had lives. They had had routines. She had had a routine once. The 73 bus. The Cruciform. The library. The routine had been a form of belonging. She had lost it. She had not found a new one. The job search had been a routine of sorts. Apply. Wait. Check. Repeat. The routine had not been belonging. The routine had been survival. She had survived. She would survive. The choice to keep going had been the only choice she had. She had made it. She would make it again.

The café closed at ten. She left. The street was cold. Beijing in February. The cold cut differently than London. Drier. Sharper. She had walked back to Ye Ming's flat. The route had taken twenty minutes. She had passed the convenience store. She had passed the noodle shop. The noodle shop had been full. The smell of broth had drifted onto the street. She had not gone in. She had not been hungry. The city had glowed around her. The neon signs. The headlights. The uniform windows. She did not glow. She was a shadow. She was also a person who would show up again tomorrow. That had to mean something. She had stopped measuring herself by offers. She had started measuring by whether she could show up. Day after day. The shift was internal. The external resolution—the job, the flat, the belonging—had not arrived. But she had already begun the turn. She would stay. She would apply again. She would wait again. The sublet had held her. Ye Ming's flat had held her. The city would hold her. Or it would not. She would show up anyway. She had crossed the street. The traffic had been light. A taxi had slowed. She had waved it on. She had reached the building. The doorman had nodded. She had taken the elevator. The numbers had lit. She had stood in the corridor. She had heard the television through Ye Ming's door. She had knocked. He had opened. He had been in the kitchen. The smell of rice.

"I made dinner. Have you eaten?"

She had not. "No."

"Sit. I'll serve."

She sat at the table. He served the food. He did not ask about the interview. He had learned. Or he had given up asking. She did not know which.

"How was your day?" she asked.

"Fine. Meetings. The usual. Yours?"

"Same. Applications. Waiting."

"Any news from the consulting firm?"

"Nothing. It's been two weeks. I've stopped checking every hour."

"That's probably healthier."

"Probably. Doesn't make it easier."

"I know." He had served the rice. "Eat. The food's getting cold."

"I will. How was work?"

"Busy. Client presentation. The usual. Nothing exciting."

"Okay." She had picked up her chopsticks. "I have something to tell you," he said.

She looked at him. His eyes met hers. That was unusual. He had a way of nodding without quite meeting your eyes. This time he held her gaze. "I applied to Oxford. For my master's. I was rejected."

She had not known that. She had never known that. "When?"

"2019. Before you left for UCL." He set down his chopsticks. "I've never told you. I've never told anyone. I told myself it didn't matter. I had Tsinghua. I had PKU. I had a path. But when you left—when you got in—I wondered. I wondered if a UK degree would have opened more doors. I wondered if I had failed."

She did not know what to say. "You didn't fail."

"I know. I know that now. But I spent a long time proving it. Proving that the domestic path was enough. Proving that I didn't need to leave."

"Why are you telling me this now?"

"Because you've been carrying this alone. And I've been saying 没事，我来. As if I could fix it. I can't. I never could fix your job search. I can only—" He had stopped. "Listen. I can only listen. I'm sorry I didn't do that sooner."

"You tried. That mattered."

"Did it? Or did it make you feel like you couldn't do it yourself?"

She was quiet. The question hung between them. The refrigerator hummed. The city glowed through the window. "Both. It made me feel like I couldn't do it myself. And it also—" She had not known she would say this. "It also meant I had somewhere to sleep. Someone who cared. I resented it. I'm also grateful."

He nodded. This time his eyes stayed on hers. "I don't want you to resent me."

"I don't. Not anymore. Not for this."

"Good." He had picked up his chopsticks. He had not eaten. "The consulting firm. Any news?"

"Nothing. It's been two weeks."

"They might still call."

"Maybe. I've stopped checking every hour. It doesn't help."

"What does help?"

"Applying. To other places. Showing up. Waiting."

"Waiting. The hardest part."

"The hardest part." She had looked at him. "You never had to wait. Not like this. Tsinghua. PKU. Asset management. You had a path."

"I had a path. I also had a rejection. I just didn't talk about it."

"I know. Now I know. Thank you."

"I hope they do. Call."

"Me too." She had not said that to him before. She had not admitted hope. "Thank you. For telling me. About Oxford."

"You're not the only one who's wondered if they're enough."

"I know. Now I know. Thank you for telling me."

"I should have told you years ago. When you got into UCL. I was happy for you. I was also—envious. I told myself it didn't matter. Tsinghua was enough. PKU was enough. And it was. But the envy was there."

"I didn't know."

"I didn't want you to. I didn't want anyone to. I built a life. I proved I could do it without leaving. And I could. But the cost was—I never had to face what you're facing. The room where they don't know you. The CV that doesn't translate. I had a path. You're building yours from scratch."

"From scratch. That's what it feels like."

"I know. I can't fix it. But I can sit with it. If that helps."

"It does. More than you know."

The flat had held them. The smell of rice. The smell of the vegetables he had cooked. Chaoyang at night. The uniform blocks. Some lit. Some dark. Ye Ming's flat was one of the lit ones. He had a life. He had built it. He had never left. He had applied to Oxford. He had been rejected. He had never told her. He had never told anyone. The inequality was named. In naming, it began to shift. She had wanted him to listen. She had wanted to scream it. She had never said it. She had pulled away instead. And now he was admitting he could not help. He was admitting his ease was luck. He was listening. She could feel the difference. "I'm glad you tried," she said. It was true. She had resented it. She was also glad. The flat was still his. The belonging was still uneven. But something had changed. He had stopped solving. He was listening.

"I'm glad you're here," he said. He did not say more. She ate. The food was good. She could taste it now. She would tell her mother one true thing. She had decided. It's harder than I expected. She would say the market was hard. It was a start.

She had waited a day before calling her mother. She had needed to prepare. She had needed to know what she would say. It's harder than I expected. She had rehearsed it. She had rehearsed the tone. She had rehearsed the deflection for the follow-up questions. Her mother would ask about Ye Ming. Her mother would ask about marriage. Her mother would ask when Lin Wan would settle down. Lin Wan would not answer those questions. She would answer the one question she had decided to answer. The job market. The difficulty. The one true thing. She had stood by the window in Ye Ming's flat. The city had glowed below. The uniform blocks. Some lit. Some dark. She had pressed the call button. Her mother had answered on the second ring. Lin Wan had read about filial expectations. Chinese families maintained significant expectations that educated young adults would return from studies and marry. The expectations were rooted in filial piety. In Confucian values. Children were expected to fulfill family obligations. To respect parental authority in major life decisions. Marriage was one of those decisions. Lin Wan had not married. She had not found a job. She had returned. She had carried the expectations with her. She had deflected them. 再说吧. She had deflected for months. "妈。"

"晚晚。工作怎么样了？"

Lin Wan had rehearsed this. She had rehearsed it a hundred times. She had always deflected. 再说吧. We'll see. The phrase had been her shield. Her refusal to commit. Her refusal to need. Her refusal to admit. This time she would not deflect. This time she would say something real. "比我想象的难。" It's harder than I expected.

The silence on the other end. Her mother's breath. The sound of the television in the background. The sound of Hangzhou. Of home. "什么？"

"找工作。市场比较难。12.7 million毕业生。竞争很激烈。" She had not planned to say the number. It had come out. Her mother might not understand. Her mother might not care about the number. Her mother might only hear that her daughter was struggling. "我在努力。会找到的。"

"晚晚。" Her mother's voice cracked. Lin Wan had never heard that. "你一个人在北京，不要太拼。身体要紧。"

"我知道。妈，我没事。"

"有需要跟妈妈说。钱够不够？"

"够。" She had not wanted to talk about money. The savings were dwindling. She had not told her mother how much was left.

"真的够？"

"真的。妈，我会找到的。只是需要一点时间。"

"你弟弟说北京竞争大。他说你要是累了就回来。杭州也有机会。"

"我知道。我还没累。" She had been tired. She had been exhausted. She had not said that. "妈，我会找到的。相信我。"

"晚晚，妈不是催你。妈就是担心。你一个人那么远。妈晚上睡不着就想你。"

"妈，你别担心。我住叶明那里。有地方住。有饭吃。"

"叶明那孩子好。他妈妈跟我说了。你考虑考虑。工作慢慢找。人要紧。"

"再说吧。妈，工作的事我会搞定的。"

"晚晚，妈知道你能干。妈就是——你从小就要强。什么事都自己扛。妈怕你扛不住。"

"妈，我没事。就是想说。比想象中难。不想再瞒你了。"

"好。妈知道了。你辛苦了。"

"我知道。"

"你吃饭了吗？"

"吃了。"

"睡得好吗？"

"还好。"

Her mother was quiet. Lin Wan could hear her breathing. The television had been muted. "你辛苦了。有需要跟妈妈说。"

"妈，谢谢你。"

"谢什么。你是妈的女儿。妈就希望你过得好。"

"I know. I'm trying."

"晚晚，妈知道你不容易。一个人在外面。妈年轻的时候也难。你外婆也催。妈懂。"

Lin Wan had not expected that. "妈——"

"你慢慢来。身体要紧。工作会有的。别急。"

"好。妈，谢谢你。"

"谢什么。你是妈的女儿。妈就希望你过得好。"

"我知道。我会的。"

"好。妈，我挂了。"

"好。注意身体。"

Her mother touched her wedding ring when she was about to say something difficult. Lin Wan could not see it. She could imagine it. Thirty years of marriage. The habit of a lifetime. This time she had not deflected. She had said one true thing. It's harder than I expected. She had said the market was hard. She had not said she was ordinary. She had not said the degree felt like a mask. She had not said she was one of the 30 percent. She had said enough.

The conversation did not resolve. It shifted. Her mother did not ask about Ye Ming. She did not ask when Lin Wan would settle down. She asked if Lin Wan was eating enough. If she was sleeping. If she needed money. Lin Wan said no. She said she was fine. She was not fine. She was also not lying in the same way. She had told one true thing. The expectation remained. The pressure remained. The marriage question would return. "那个叶明" would return. But she had cracked the dynamic open. She had spoken. Her mother had heard. The dynamic had shifted. Not resolved. Shifted. Lin Wan ended the call. She pressed her thumb into her palm. Then she released it. She had done it. She had told her mother one true thing. She would do it again. When she was ready. When she had more to say. The one true thing had cost something. It had also meant something. She had moved from deflection to something like honesty. 再说吧 had begun to crack. The phrase had been her shield. Her refusal to commit. Her refusal to need. Her refusal to admit. She had said something real. The shift was small. It was also real.

In an office on the fifteenth floor of a glass tower in Chaoyang, Xu Qing sat at her desk. The day had ended. The building was quiet. The fluorescent lights had stayed on. She had turned off the overhead. The desk lamp had been enough. She had Lin Wan's CV in front of her. She had the evaluation forms. She had the notes from the final round. Lin Wan had performed well. She had performed as well as Zhou Xiao. Better in some areas. Worse in others. The salary question. Lin Wan had said fifteen to twenty-five thousand. She had said she was flexible. She had not said she would take anything. Xu Qing had heard that before. She had said it herself. In 2021. When she had been the one in the chair. The decision was Xu Qing's. She had been burned before. 2022. She had advocated for a returnee hire. The candidate had lasted four months. Her manager had questioned her judgment. She had been conservative ever since. She had become the person who said no because saying yes once cost her. She had become the system she once raged against. She saw herself in Lin Wan. The returnee who expected more. The returnee who had to prove herself. That recognition made her colder. Not warmer. Because recognition was dangerous. If she passed Lin Wan through, she would be taking a risk. If she filtered Lin Wan out, she would be replicating the skepticism she had faced. She would be doing to Lin Wan what had been done to her. Her fingers found the fountain pen in her blazer pocket. She had not used it during the interview. She had not used it during the evaluation. She held it now. She was deciding. She thought about the candidate who had failed. She thought about the hundreds of CVs on her desk. She thought about Lin Wan's face when she had said "we'll take another look." The hope. The doubt. The mask. Xu Qing had returned from Warwick. She had taken six months to find her first role. She knew what it cost. She knew the gap between "UCL, MSc" on paper and the person in the interview chair. She had become the person who evaluated that gap. The gatekeeper. She held the key. The 2017 study had found overseas graduates received fewer callbacks. The 2024 data had shown a shift. Half of employers offered returnees better compensation. Xu Qing embodied both. She could pass Lin Wan through. She could filter her out. The decision was hers. Xu Qing's fingers left the pen. She returned it to her pocket. She opened the system. She passed Lin Wan's CV to the next round. One small choice. No grand redemption. She clicked send. The email went out. The decision was made. The gatekeeper had chosen to bend. She had closed the laptop. She had looked out the window. The city had glowed below. Chaoyang at night. The uniform blocks. Some lit. Some dark. She had not known which window was Lin Wan's. She had not needed to know. She had gathered her bag. She had left the office. The corridor had been empty. The elevator had descended. She had gone home.

Lin Wan did not know that Xu Qing had passed her through. She would not know until the offer arrived. She had already begun the turn. She had told her mother one true thing. She had heard Ye Ming's admission. She had faced the dark night. The internal shift had happened before the external resolution. She had stopped measuring herself by offers. She had started measuring by presence. The offer would confirm that shift. It would not create it. She lay in the spare room that night. The city glowed through the window. She pressed her thumb into her palm. Then she released it. She would find out about the offer in the morning. Or she would not. She would show up anyway. She fell asleep. The flat held her. The city held her. The choice held her. She was here.

# Chapter 4: Choosing

Three months and two weeks after she had stepped off the train at Beijing South, Lin Wan had a routine. She woke at seven. She made tea. She checked her email. She had applied to 127 positions. Twenty-three rejections. Two interviews. One callback. Zero offers. The routine was a form of waiting. The waiting was a form of survival. She had told her mother one true thing. She had heard Ye Ming's admission. She had faced the dark night. She had chosen to show up again. The internal shift had happened. The external resolution had not come. She had continued applying. She had continued waiting. She had continued showing up. The choice to stay had been made before she knew the outcome. The outcome would come when it came. Or it would not. She would stay anyway. She would show up anyway. She had learned that. She had learned it in the dark night. She had learned it in Ye Ming's flat. She had learned it in the silence after interviews. The choice was the point. The presence was the point. The showing up was the point. The offer would be a gift. It would not be the point. She had read about the employment downgrade phenomenon. Highly educated Chinese graduates increasingly took low-skilled sales and service roles. The fundamental mismatch: record graduate waves entered the market while real estate, finance, and tech sectors retreated. She had not taken a low-skilled role. She had held out. She had applied to consulting. To finance. To roles that required her degree. The offer, when it came, would be entry-level. It would not be what she had imagined. It would be a start. She had already decided she would take it. She had already decided she would stay. The decision had been made before the email arrived. The email would confirm it. It would not create it. Some mornings she had woken and the first thought had been: check the email. Some mornings she had woken and the first thought had been: apply again. The two thoughts had coexisted. The hope and the habit. The habit had carried her when the hope had not been enough.

The email arrived on a Thursday morning. Lin Wan was in Ye Ming's flat. She had made tea. The morning light came through the window. She had woken at seven. She had checked her email. Nothing. She had made tea. She had sat by the window. The city had been waking below. The traffic had been building. The buses had been moving. She had checked again. The email had arrived at 7:34. The subject line: Offer of Employment—Consulting Analyst Position. She read it once. She read it again. The salary was eighteen thousand yuan a month. Base. With benefits. Total employment packages in tier-1 China typically included annual bonuses of one to three months, social insurance, housing subsidies of 10 to 15 percent in Beijing. She had not negotiated. She had accepted. The role was entry-level. It was not what she had imagined when she had left London. It was not the mid-level position that 60 percent of returnees in foreign firms occupied. It was a start.

Her phone had rung an hour later. A Beijing number she did not recognize. "Lin Wan? This is HR from the consulting firm. We've sent the offer. Have you received it?"

"Yes. I have."

"Good. We'd like to confirm your acceptance. Can you reply by end of day?"

"I'll reply now."

"Excellent. Start date is in two weeks. You'll receive the contract by email. Any questions?"

"What should I bring on the first day? ID, documents?"

"ID, bank details for payroll, and your signed contract. We'll send a checklist. You'll report to the fifteenth floor. Same building as your interviews."

"Same floor. I remember."

"Your manager will be in touch before your start date. She'll introduce you to the team. Anything else?"

"Who do I ask if I have questions about the contract? Benefits?"

"Reply to the contract email. HR will respond within twenty-four hours. The benefits package is in the attachment—social insurance, housing fund, annual bonus. Standard tier-one terms."

"Thank you. I appreciate it."

"One more thing. Dress code is business casual. No suit required after the first week. The kitchen has coffee. Help yourself."

"Good to know. Thank you."

"Welcome to the team. We look forward to having you."

"Thank you. I look forward to starting."

She had ended the call. She had stood by the window. The city had continued below. She had read the email a third time. The start date. The reporting manager. The address. The same building. The same floor. The same elevator. She would take it every morning. She would have a desk. She would have a role. She had already decided she would stay. She had already decided before the email arrived. The offer was a gift. She would take it. She had stopped measuring herself by the degree. The outcome no longer defined her. The mask was no longer needed. She had chosen to belong by presence. The offer confirmed that choice. It did not create it. Xu Qing had passed her through. One small choice. No grand redemption. The gatekeeper had chosen to bend. Lin Wan had chosen to show up. The choice and the offer were intertwined. Her hands were still. Her thumb was not in her palm. She noticed that. She had noticed it less lately. The habit had begun to fade. She replied to accept. She would start in two weeks. She had a job. She had a path. The city did not yet feel like home. She would show up anyway. Ye Ming had left for work. The flat had been quiet. She had not told him yet. She would tell him that evening. She had sat with the news. The tea had gone cold. She had not noticed. She had smiled. The smile had felt unfamiliar. It had also felt earned. She had read the email a fourth time. The salary. The start date. The benefits. The words had not changed. The offer had been real. She had replied to accept. She had pressed send. The email had gone out. She had sat in the silence. The silence had been different. The silence had not been the sound of waiting. The silence had been the sound of something completed. She had not arrived. She had chosen to arrive. The offer had been the confirmation. The choice had been the point. She had made the choice. She had made it in the dark night. She had made it in Ye Ming's flat. She had made it when she had told her mother one true thing. She had made it when she had faced the degree as mask and had chosen to show up anyway. The offer had been the gift. The choice had been the work. She had done the work. She had received the gift. She had not known what to do next. She had made more tea. She had sat by the window. The city had continued below. She had continued with it. She had a job. She had a path. The path had not been guaranteed. The path had been chosen. She had chosen it. She would walk it.

She had not told Zhou Xiao congratulations. She had put it off. She had told herself she would do it when she had news. When she could mean it. She had news now. She could mean it now. She opened WeChat. Zhou Xiao's profile. The last message: 拿到offer了！感谢大家！Lin Wan typed: 恭喜！为你高兴。She sent it. She meant it.

Zhou Xiao had replied within minutes: 谢谢！你怎么样？有消息了吗？

Lin Wan had typed: 也有了。同一家。

Zhou Xiao: 真的？太好了！

Lin Wan: 真的。下下周入职。

Zhou Xiao: 那我们以后是同事了！一起吃饭！

Lin Wan: 好。一定。

Zhou Xiao: 恭喜你。我们都在同一条船上了。你面试了几轮？

Lin Wan: 两轮。你呢？

Zhou Xiao: 也是两轮。HR说我们可能在一个组。到时候见！

Lin Wan: 好。到时候见。

Zhou Xiao: 恭喜你。我们都在同一条船上了。

Lin Wan had typed: 是啊。终于。She had sent it. The 12.7 million were in the same boat. Zhou Xiao had gotten the job. Lin Wan had gotten a job. They had both made it. Or they had both survived. The distinction mattered less than it had. Lin Wan could refuse to be diminished by Zhou Xiao's success. She could celebrate it. Solidarity had won. The rivalry had softened into recognition. They had been strangers. They had been rivals. They were something like allies now. Or at least, they were two people who had stood in the same queues. Who had handed over the same CVs. Who had waited in the same silence. The texture of the phone screen under her thumb. The send confirmation. She had done it. She had texted congratulations. She had meant it. Zhou Xiao had sent: 以后一起吃饭！Lin Wan had replied: 好。She had put the phone down. She had smiled. The smile had felt unfamiliar. It had also felt earned.

She told Ye Ming that evening. He had cooked. The smell of rice and vegetables filled the flat. The steam rose from the bowls. She had waited until he had served the food. Until they had sat down.

"I got the offer. The consulting firm. I start in two weeks."

He had been reaching for the soy sauce. His hand paused. He looked at her. This time his eyes met hers. "I'm glad."

"Eighteen thousand. Base. Entry-level. It's not what I imagined when I left London. But it's a start."

"It's a start," he repeated. He picked up his chopsticks. "When do you start?"

"Two weeks. I need to find a room. I can't stay here forever."

"You can stay as long as you need. There's no rush."

"I know. I'll find something. A sublet. Three months. Something. I've been looking online. Chaoyang is expensive but there are shared flats."

"Shared is fine. You'll save money. Build up a buffer."

"That's the plan. First paycheck goes to rent. Second to savings. Third to—I don't know. Maybe I'll finally buy myself a proper coffee maker."

He had smiled. "The office has free coffee."

"I know. I've heard. Chen said it's terrible."

"He's not wrong. But it's free."

"Still. I'll take it. Free terrible coffee beats no coffee."

"True. You've earned it. The job. The coffee. All of it."

He had picked up his chopsticks. "Okay. Just—don't rush. The offer's yours. You've got time."

"I've got time." She had repeated it. She had not had time for months. She had had nothing but time. The phrase had meant something different now. "Thank you. For everything. The room. The contacts. For not—" She had stopped. "For not giving up on me when I pushed you away."

"I didn't give up." He had looked at her. "I didn't know how to help. But I didn't give up."

"I know. Thank you." She had not wanted to cry. She had not cried. "I'm glad you tried," she said. "I know I pushed you away. I know your help felt like—" She did not finish. She did not need to. "Thank you. For the room. For the contacts. For listening."

He did not say 没事，我来. He did not fill the silence with action. He said, "You would have found something. With or without me."

"Maybe. But you tried. That mattered."

"Did it?"

"Yes." She had not hesitated. "I resented it. I also needed it. Both were true."

He nodded. "I'm glad."

"Me too."

"Zhou Xiao. Same firm?"

"Yes. She got the offer first. I got the callback."

"Same boat."

"Same boat."

He ate. The space between them was smaller than before. The flat was still his. The belonging was still uneven. But she could say thank you without resentment. She could acknowledge what he had done without feeling indebted. The dynamic had shifted. He had stopped solving. She had stopped needing to be solved. They were something closer to equal. Not equal. Closer. The flat no longer symbolized her indebtedness. It had been a waystation. She would find her own place. She would keep the job. She would build something. The flat had held her. Now she could leave it. She could also stay until she found a room. The choice was hers. The belonging was hers to choose. She had chosen Beijing. She had chosen to stay. She had chosen to show up. The flat had been part of that. Ye Ming had been part of that. She was grateful. She was also free.

Her mother called the next day. "晚晚，听说你找到工作了？"

"嗯。咨询公司。下下周入职。" Lin Wan stood by the window. The city spread below. The morning light had come through the glass. She had told her mother one true thing. Now she could tell her she had found something.

"什么公司？工资怎么样？"

"咨询公司。做分析师。工资还可以。"

"多少？"

"够用。" She had not said the number. Her mother would compare. "Entry-level. 刚入职。慢慢来。"

"晚晚，妈就问问。你弟弟在杭州，工资也还可以。妈不是比较。妈就是担心你一个人。"

"我知道。妈。工资够我租房吃饭。还有余的。"

"那就好。"

"我知道。妈，我没事。真的。"

"那就好。晚晚，妈为你高兴。你一个人在北京，不容易。"

"谢谢妈。" Her mother would compare it to her brother's. She would compare it to Ye Ming's. The comparison would not be fair. The comparison would happen anyway.

"晚晚，妈就是问问。你弟弟在杭州，房子也看了。妈就担心你一个人在北京。"

"我没事。妈。真的。"

"那就好。晚晚，妈就放心了。" Her mother's voice had softened. "什么时候搬出去？还住叶明那里？"

"找到房子就搬。在找。"

"那个叶明，你们——"

"妈，我这边要准备入职。先不说了。"

"好。好。你忙。有空回来看看。妈给你寄点东西？吃的？"

"不用。妈。我这边都有。"

"好。那你照顾好自己。晚晚，妈为你高兴。"

"谢谢妈。妈，我挂了。"

"好。注意身体。"

She had not wanted to have that conversation. Not yet. The expectation remained. "那个叶明" would return. But she had cracked the dynamic open. Her mother had asked if Lin Wan was happy. Lin Wan had said she was. She had meant it. She was relieved. Something like hope. Quiet. Bittersweet. The hope of presence. The hope of choosing. Day after day.

The next two weeks passed in a blur. Lin Wan had needed to find a room. She had needed to sign the employment contract. She had searched for rooms online. Chaoyang was expensive. She had filtered by price. She had filtered by distance to the office. She had found twelve listings. She had visited four. The first had been too small. The second had smelled of cigarettes. The third had been perfect. The landlord had asked for six months upfront. She had not had six months. The fourth had been a sublet. A room in a shared flat. Three months. The landlord had been a woman in her forties. "What do you do?"

"Consulting. I just started."

"Stable?"

"是的。刚入职。"

"Which company?"

"A consulting firm. Chaoyang. Analyst role."

"Good. I prefer stable tenants. Students come and go. Professionals stay longer."

"I plan to stay. At least a year."

"Deposit is one month. Rent monthly. You can move in next week. Any questions?"

"Utilities included?"

"No. You pay electricity and water. Split with the other tenant. Internet is shared."

"Understood. Thank you."

"One more thing. No pets. No smoking. Quiet after ten. The other tenant works early."

"Understood. I'm quiet. No pets."

"Good. You can move in Monday. I'll send the contract."

"Thank you. I appreciate it."

She had not asked about the degree. She had not asked about London. She had asked about the deposit. Lin Wan had paid it. She had moved out of Ye Ming's spare room. He had helped her carry her suitcase. "I can take it from here."

"Sure?"

"I'm sure. Thank you. For everything."

"Keep in touch."

"I will."

"Good luck. With the job."

"Thanks. You too."

He had not offered to do more. He had learned. She had learned. They had both learned. The elevator had descended. The lobby had been the same. The doorman had nodded. Ye Ming had nodded back. She had stood on the pavement with her suitcase. The traffic had passed. The city had continued. He had said to keep in touch. She had said she would. The flat was still his. The path was still his. But she had her own path now. She had her own room. She had her own job. The smell was still unfamiliar—previous tenants' soap, someone else's habits. But it was hers. Her name on the agreement. Her key. The belonging was still uneven. It was also chosen. She had chosen it. She had chosen Beijing. She had chosen to stay when China had not yet chosen her back. The choice had cost something. It had also meant something. The employment contract had included the standard terms. Annual bonuses of one to three months. Social insurance. Housing subsidy. She had not negotiated. She had needed the job. She had wanted the job. The degree had not guaranteed it. Xu Qing had chosen to pass her through. Lin Wan had chosen to show up. The choice and the offer were intertwined. She had earned it. She had also been given it. Both were true.

The first day at the new job had been a blur of introductions and orientation. Lin Wan had met her manager. A woman in her forties. She had shaken Lin Wan's hand.

"Welcome. I'm your reporting manager. Any questions about the role?"

"Not yet. I'm still orienting."

"Chen will show you around. Don't hesitate to ask. The first week is mostly learning the systems. Client work starts in week two."

"Understood. What does a typical day look like?"

"Meetings in the morning. Analysis in the afternoon. Deadlines vary. We'll pair you with a senior analyst for your first few projects."

"Thank you."

"Anything else before I hand you off to Chen?"

"Just—thank you. For the opportunity."

"Don't thank me yet. Wait until you've survived your first client deadline." She had smiled. It had been brief. "Chen will take it from here."

She had assigned a buddy. A man named Chen. He had shown her the kitchen. The bathroom. The printer. "Templates are here. Client files here. Coffee machine—help yourself."

"Thanks. How long have you been here?"

"Two years. Started as an analyst. Same as you. The learning curve is steep but you get used to it."

"Where did you study?"

"UCL. Economics."

"Nice. We have a few returnees. You'll fit in. The team's used to it. Different backgrounds. Different paths."

"Good to know. Who else is on the team?"

"Four analysts. Two seniors. Xu Qing runs HR. You'll see her around. She's the one who pushed for returnee hires. Don't tell her I said that."

"I won't. Thanks."

She had nodded. He had shown her where the templates were stored. He had said to ask if she had questions. She had had many questions. She had asked three. She had met her colleagues. Some had asked about her background. UCL, they had said. Impressive. She had nodded. She had not said that the degree had not opened doors. She had not said that she had applied to 127 positions. She had not said that she had been one of the 30 percent. She had not said that she had lived in Ye Ming's spare room for months. She had said she was glad to be there. She had meant it. The office was in the same glass tower where she had interviewed. The fifteenth floor. The same elevator. The same polished metal. The reflection had shown her: professional clothes, hair pulled back, the face she had worn to interviews. Now she wore it to work. She had a desk. She had a laptop. She had a role. Consulting analyst. Entry-level. The salary was eighteen thousand yuan. Base. With benefits. The desk had been clean. A keyboard. A mouse. A notepad. A pen. The pen had been black. It had not been a fountain pen. She had not seen Xu Qing on the first day. She had seen her in the corridor on the third. Xu Qing had been carrying a folder. She had looked at Lin Wan.

"Lin Wan. Settling in?"

"Yes. Thank you."

"Good. The first week is always the hardest. Don't hesitate to ask Chen if you have questions."

"I won't. Thank you. I—thank you. For the opportunity."

Xu Qing had paused. "You earned it. The work will show. Don't overthink it."

"Understood. Thank you."

Xu Qing had nodded. She had not said anything else. Lin Wan had nodded back. She had not said thank you for the chance. The thank you would be in the work. In the showing up. In the proving that the returnee had been worth the risk. Xu Qing had taken the risk. Lin Wan would make it worth it.

The sublet had a single window. It looked out onto a courtyard. Not the uniform blocks of Chaoyang. Not the view from Ye Ming's flat. A courtyard. A few trees. The branches had been bare when she had moved in. They had leafed out. Beijing in spring. The city had warmed. The cold had softened. She had seen the first buds. She had seen the leaves unfurl. She had not noticed the exact day. She had noticed the change. The seasons had continued. She had continued with them. Lin Wan took the bus to work. The bus was different from the 73. The route was different. The sound was different. The rumble of the engine. The crush of bodies. The three-tone chime when the doors closed. Beijing. Not London. She had chosen it. She had chosen to be here. The bus carried her to the office. Wake. Tea. Bus. Office. Work. Bus. Room. The routine was a form of belonging. She had built it. She had chosen it. The city did not yet feel like home. She was building something anyway. The sublet was still not home. The smell was still unfamiliar. But it was hers. Her name on the agreement. Her key. She measured herself by presence. Not by offers. Not by the degree. Not by the Cruciform Building or the 73 bus or the person she had been in London. She was still that person. She was also someone new. Someone who had chosen to stay. Someone who had faced the dark night and had chosen to show up again. Someone who could text Zhou Xiao congratulations and mean it. Someone who could thank Ye Ming without resentment. Someone who could tell her mother one true thing. The Cruciform Building was still a memory. It was no longer the only measure of who she was. She had other measures now. The bus. The office. The room. The choice. The presence. The showing up. Some days the office felt familiar. Some days it felt foreign. The familiarity was growing. The foreignness was shrinking. She had learned the printer. She had learned the templates. She had learned Chen's coffee order. She had not yet learned to call it home. She had learned to call it work. Work was enough. Work was a start. She had received her first assignment. A market analysis. A client in manufacturing. She had spent two days on it. She had submitted it.

"Take a look at section three. The methodology needs tightening."

"Okay. I'll revise. What specifically?"

"The sample size. You need to justify it. And the regression assumptions. Client will ask."

"I'll add that. Anything else?"

"Also—the conclusion. Make it more actionable. Client wants recommendations, not just data. They're paying for advice, not a literature review."

"Got it. I'll make it more prescriptive."

"Good. Resubmit by Friday. Let me know if you have questions."

"Will do. Thank you. Can I ask—is the client feedback usually this direct?"

"Usually. They pay for our time. They expect results. You'll get used to it."

"Understood. Thank you."

Her manager had nodded. She had not said good job. She had not said bad job. She had said to incorporate the feedback. Lin Wan had incorporated the feedback. She had resubmitted. The cycle had continued. The work had been real. The work had been hers. She had built something. She had built a paragraph. She had built a slide. She had built a day. The days had accumulated. The accumulation had been a form of belonging. She had not arrived. She had built. The building had been the point.

She thought about Lu Yuan sometimes. His WeChat updates. His life in London. The road not taken. She could read his updates without the old sting. She had chosen her road. He had chosen his. Presence over comparison. Choosing over deserving. She had moved from "I deserve" to "I choose." The arc was complete. The story was beginning.

One evening she stood at a bus stop. The bus was late. The street was busy. Traffic. Neon. The smell of street food. Jianbing from a vendor. The vendor had called out. 煎饼！热乎的！She had not bought any. She had eaten at the office. The office had ordered lunch. She had eaten with her team. Chen had asked about her weekend. "Any plans?"

"Not really. Maybe explore the neighbourhood."

"Chaoyang has good spots. The café near the subway—decent coffee. Better than the office stuff."

"I'll check it out. How's the workload? First week was a lot."

"You get used to it. The first month is the hardest. After that it's just deadlines."

"Deadlines. I can handle those."

"Good. You'll need to. Client in manufacturing next week. You might get pulled in."

"I'll be ready. Thanks. Chen—how long did it take you before you felt like you belonged here?"

"Belonged? A few months. Maybe six. The first project that's yours—that helps. You'll get there."

"Thanks. I hope so."

"You will. Just show up. That's half of it."

He had nodded. He had not invited her anywhere. She had not expected him to. She stood and waited. She pressed her thumb into her palm. The habit. The pressure point. The body's response to not knowing what to say. She had not needed it lately. She had noticed it less. But it returned sometimes. In moments of stillness. In moments of waiting. She pressed. Then she released. She did not need to know what to say. She was here. The bus arrived. The doors opened. The three-tone chime. The same sound as the subway. Beijing. Not London. She boarded. She found a seat. The bus moved. The city moved around her. She was part of it now. Not fully. Not yet. But she had chosen to be part of it. The bus was different from the 73. The route was different. The sound was different. The rumble of the engine. The crush of bodies. The woman next to her had been on her phone. She had been speaking in a dialect Lin Wan had not recognized. The man across the aisle had been reading. A newspaper. The pages had rustled. She had looked out the window. The street had passed. The shops. The restaurants. The people. She had chosen to be here. The Cruciform Building was still a memory. The 73 bus was still a memory. London was still a memory. They had forged her. They had not defined her. She had defined herself by choosing. By showing up. By staying. The identity forged in London had collided with the brutal reality of the Chinese job market. The collision had not destroyed her. It had changed her. She had moved from "I deserve" to "I choose." The arc was complete. The phrase had shifted. 再说吧 had given way to something like 我试试. She had not said those words aloud. But the shift was there. In the way she had accepted the offer. In the way she had texted Zhou Xiao. In the way she had thanked Ye Ming. In the way she stood at the bus stop. In the way she released her thumb from her palm. She was trying. She was showing up. She was choosing. The words did not need to be spoken. The action was the language. She had moved from deflection to commitment. From "we'll see" to "I'll try." The final image embodied it. She did not need to know what to say. She was here. She had chosen to be here. The dislocation had softened. It had not disappeared. It had softened into something like belonging. Something like home. Something chosen. She was here. She would stay. She would show up. The choice was made. The arc was complete. She was here.

She had arrived at Beijing South with a suitcase and a degree. The smell of instant noodles and diesel exhaust had hit her like a wall. She had pressed her thumb into her palm. She had arrived. The word had not fit. She had been still in transit. She had left with neither belonging nor employment. She had found employment. The belonging was still building. The belonging was chosen. The final image mirrored the opening. Beijing South. The concourse. The thumb in the palm. The dislocation. Now: the bus stop. The street. The thumb released. The presence. The Cruciform Building was still a memory. The red brick against grey sky. The keyboard clatter. The silence of the library. The belonging through work. She had earned it there. She had built her identity there. Here, belonging was not earned. It was chosen. She had chosen to belong by presence. She had chosen to show up. Day after day. She was here. The bus had stopped. She had stood. She had stepped off. The pavement had been familiar now. She had walked this route before. She had walked it to the office. She had walked it home. The route had become a habit. The habit had become a form of belonging. She had not arrived. She had chosen to arrive. The difference was small. The difference was everything. She had pressed her thumb into her palm. Then she had released it. She did not need to know what to say. She was here. She would stay. She would show up. The choice was made. The arc was complete. She was here.
