# Inbox - Start Here

> This is your **GTD capture bucket**. Everything comes here first.

## How to Use the Inbox

1. **Capture** - Throw anything in here: ideas, links, quotes, tasks, random thoughts
2. **Process daily** - Go through each item and decide:
   - Is it actionable?
     - Yes -> Define next action, add to [[Actions Dashboard]]
     - No -> Is it reference? File to `03 - Resources/`. Trash? Delete it. Someday? Tag `#action/someday`
3. **Clarify** - Turn fleeting notes into literature or permanent notes
4. **File** - Move processed notes to their proper home:
   - Active work -> `01 - Projects/`
   - Ongoing responsibility -> `02 - Areas/`
   - Reference material -> `03 - Resources/` or `Sources/`
   - Evergreen insight -> `Atlas/`

## Processing Checklist

- [ ] Is the inbox empty?
- [ ] Did each item get a next action or destination?
- [ ] Are new permanent notes linked to at least one MOC?
- [ ] Are action items on the [[Actions Dashboard]]?

## Quick Capture

> Use the **Fleeting Note** template (Ctrl/Cmd+T) for fast capture.
