> Sometimes I merge, process, group or modify notes when they seem related. I delete a note only rarely. Notes that repeatedly don't deserve attention will naturally continue to sink. They are never lost, they just don't deserve the top of mind.

> I realize while I'm re-ordering some of my notes that I've actually thought about the same thing a lot but from different perspectives. I process it a bit more, merge some of the notes into one. I feel additional insight.

> When I note something down, I feel that I can immediately move on, wipe my working memory, and focus fully on something else at that time. I have confidence that I'll be able to revisit that idea later during review and process it when I have more time.

> My note has grown quite giant over the last few years. It feels nice to scroll through some of the old things/thoughts that occupied me a long time ago. Sometimes ideas don't stand the repeated scrutiny of a review and they just sink deeper down. Sometimes I'm surprised that I've thought about something for so long. And sometimes an idea from a while ago is suddenly relevant in a new light.

> The only exception is that I use tags like "watch:", "listen:", or "read:", so they are easy to CTRL+F for when I'm looking for something to watch late at night, listen to during a run/walk, or read during a flight, etc.
