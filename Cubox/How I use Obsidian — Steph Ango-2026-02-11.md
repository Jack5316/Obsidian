> Throughout the day I use Obsidian’s unique note hotkey to write individual thoughts as they come up. This shortcut automatically creates a note with the prefix YYYY-MM-DD HHmm to which I may add a title that describes the idea.

> Why this scale? I like rating out of 7 better than 4 or 5 because I need more granularity at the top, for the good experiences, and 10 is too granular.

> I use a static site generator called Jekyll to automatically compile my notes into a website and convert them from Markdown to HTML.

> The color palette is Flexoki, which I created for this site. My Jekyll template is not public, but you can get similar results from this template by Maxime Vaillancourt. There are also many alternatives to Jekyll you can use to compile your site such as Quartz, Astro, Eleventy, and Hugo.
