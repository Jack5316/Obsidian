# How I Use This Vault

This vault blends three knowledge management systems into one:

## The Three Pillars

### 1. PARA (Tiago Forte) - Where Things Live

- **Projects** (`01 - Projects/`) - Active work with a clear end goal and deadline
- **Areas** (`02 - Areas/`) - Ongoing responsibilities with standards to maintain
- **Resources** (`03 - Resources/`) - Topics of interest for future reference
- **Archive** (`04 - Archive/`) - Inactive items from the above three

> **Rule**: Every note lives in ONE PARA folder. If it's actionable, it's a Project. If it's ongoing, it's an Area. If it's reference, it's a Resource. If it's done, it's Archive.

### 2. LYT / Linking Your Thinking (Nick Milo) - How Things Connect

- **Home** (`Home.md`) - The dashboard, your starting point
- **Maps of Content** (`Maps/`) - Topic hubs that link related notes together
- **Atlas** (`Atlas/`) - Permanent/evergreen notes: atomic ideas in your own words
- **Sources** (`Sources/`) - Literature notes from external sources

> **Rule**: Every permanent note should link to at least one MOC. MOCs are living documents that grow with your knowledge.

### 3. GTD (David Allen) - What To Do Next

- **Inbox** (`00 - Inbox/`) - Capture everything here first
- **Actions Dashboard** (`02 - Areas/Actions Dashboard.md`) - Next actions, waiting, someday
- **Weekly Review** - Process, review, and plan weekly

> **Rule**: Process inbox daily. Do the weekly review. Every project has a clear next action.

## The Workflow

```
Capture -> Process -> Organize -> Distill -> Express -> Review
```

1. **Capture**: Throw everything into Inbox (use Fleeting Note template)
2. **Process**: Clarify each item - is it actionable? Reference? Trash?
3. **Organize**: File into the right PARA folder
4. **Distill**: Extract insights into permanent notes (Atlas/)
5. **Express**: Use knowledge to build, write, create
6. **Review**: Weekly review keeps the system alive

## Note Progression

```
Fleeting Note -> Literature Note -> Permanent Note
(raw capture)    (from a source)    (your own idea)
```

- **Fleeting notes** are disposable - process or delete within 48 hours
- **Literature notes** summarize a source in your words
- **Permanent notes** are atomic ideas that stand alone forever

## Tips

- Link generously - connections are where insight lives
- One idea per permanent note - keep them atomic
- MOCs are not folders - they're curated, opinionated collections
- Review is not optional - a system you don't maintain decays
- Start messy - you can always refine later
