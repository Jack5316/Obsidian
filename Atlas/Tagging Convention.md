# Tagging Convention

> Tags complement folders and links. Use them for filtering and searching, not for organization (that's what folders and MOCs are for).

## Status Tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `#status/inbox` | Unprocessed, needs attention |
| `#status/processing` | Being worked on, not yet finalized |
| `#status/evergreen` | Mature, reliable, done |
| `#status/archived` | No longer active |

## Type Tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `#type/fleeting` | Quick capture, temporary |
| `#type/literature` | Notes from a source |
| `#type/permanent` | Evergreen atomic note |
| `#type/project` | Active project |
| `#type/moc` | Map of Content |
| `#type/daily` | Daily note |
| `#type/review` | Weekly/monthly review |

## AI Domain Tags

| `#ai/llm` | Large Language Models |
| `#ai/ml` | Machine Learning |
| `#ai/deep-learning` | Neural networks, deep learning |

## Rules

1. **Every note gets a `#type/` and `#status/` tag** at minimum
2. **Domain tags are optional** but helpful for filtering
3. **Nest tags with `/`** for hierarchy (Obsidian supports this natively)
4. **Don't over-tag** - if a link or MOC connection captures it, you don't need a tag too
5. **Tags are for filtering, links are for connecting, folders are for filing**
