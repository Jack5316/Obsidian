# Life Decisions as Inverse Problems

I first learned about inverse problems in a dusty linear algebra lecture hall, where the professor scribbled matrices on a whiteboard and complained about how "the easy direction is never the one we care about." At the time, I thought he was talking about math. It would take years to realize he was talking about *life*.

The forward problem, as he explained it, is trivial. Given a system—say, a matrix **A**—and an input **x**, you just multiply them to get the output **b = Ax**. It’s mechanical, predictable, the kind of thing you can do half-asleep. But the inverse problem? That’s where the work lives: you *see* **b**, the outcome you want, and you have to find the **x** that would get you there. It didn’t hit me until I was staring at a job offer, trying to reverse-engineer whether it would lead to the life I wanted, that this was exactly the structure of every hard choice I’d ever faced.

Most of us don’t approach decisions by picking an input and calculating its outcome. We don’t think, "If I study biology, move to Portland, take this entry-level lab job—what will happen?" Instead, we start with the *output*: we imagine a life with creative freedom, financial stability, time to hike on weekends, and we ask—*what choices do I need to make to get here?* That’s the inverse problem, and it’s hard for the same mathematical reasons that stumped me in that lecture hall. Some desired **b**s have no solution at all; no combination of choices will get you from where you are to that exact outcome, no matter how hard you try. Others have infinitely many solutions, which sounds like freedom until you’re paralyzed by analysis, unable to pick between three paths that all seem to lead to the same place. And worst of all are the ill-conditioned problems, where a tiny shift in what you *think* you want—say, mistaking "being a lawyer" for "feeling respected"—sends you chasing a completely different set of inputs, only to realize you solved the wrong problem entirely.

Mathematicians have a trick for this: regularization. Instead of demanding the *perfect* inverse, they add constraints—like Tikhonov regularization, which favors solutions that are both close to the desired outcome *and* simple. It turns out this is the best strategy for life decisions, too. I’ve learned to apply my own version of regularization: a simplicity bias that picks the path with fewer moving parts, a "do no harm" constraint that avoids choices that close off future options, a values check that ensures the solution aligns with what I actually care about, not just what I think I *should* want. These constraints don’t make the problem easier, exactly—but they make it *solvable*. They turn a chaotic, underdetermined mess into something I can actually act on.

Of course, the analogy breaks eventually. In math, the matrix **A** is fixed; it’s a known system, unchanging over time. In life, the system itself is shaped by our choices. Every decision we make rewrites the matrix a little, so the inverse problem we face tomorrow isn’t the same one we’re solving today. There’s no "true" inverse, only a series of approximations—small steps that get us closer to the **b** we want, even as that **b** itself shifts. We’re not just solving the inverse problem; we’re *redefining* it as we go.

That lecture hall feels a lifetime ago, but I still think about those matrices when I’m stuck on a decision. I remind myself that I’m not looking for the perfect input—just a regularized one, simple enough to act on, aligned enough to matter. The forward problem might be easy, but the inverse one? That’s where we build the lives we actually want.
